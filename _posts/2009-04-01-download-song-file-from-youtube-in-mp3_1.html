<p>Have you ever come across a situation where you don't have an mp3 format song file but you could find the song in youtube.The only way used to be record the song from your system mixer and save and convert it to mp3. <a href="http://listentoyoutube.com">listentoyoutube.com</a> gives a straight forward solution for it.Just paste the youtube URL in the text box in the site and download the audio as mp3.</p>
