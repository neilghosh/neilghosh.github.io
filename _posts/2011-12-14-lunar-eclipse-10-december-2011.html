This was last eclipse of the year. I had already missed the longest total lunar eclipse this year on 15th June because of bad weather. Unfortunately this time also it was cloudy when the eclipse started. However the sky became clear even before half of the moon was covered by earth's shadow. Also I was at a place which was bit far from the city light, hence managed to capture some nearby stars also.<br/><br/><a title="Totality - Total Lunar Eclipse 10 Dec 2011 Phase 3 by neilghosh, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/neilghosh/6490998705/"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7019/6490998705_9132c6c466.jpg" alt="Totality - Total Lunar Eclipse 10 Dec 2011 Phase 3" width="500" height="334" /></a><br/>My friend and colleague <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/darksarcasm/6505194133/in/photostream/" target="_blank">Nikhil Tungare</a> managed to take the full montage of the eclipse with Cyber Towers in the perspective.<br/><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/darksarcasm/6505194133/" title="Total Lunar Eclispe 10-Dec-2011 Complete Sequence by Nikhil T, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7172/6505194133_88907e13e3_b.jpg" width="506" height="898" alt="Total Lunar Eclispe 10-Dec-2011 Complete Sequence"></a><br>He has also taken an amazing <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/darksarcasm/6498160965/" target="_blank">picture of totality</a>.<br/><br/>I am waiting for pictures taken by few other photographer friends of mine and will post soon.
