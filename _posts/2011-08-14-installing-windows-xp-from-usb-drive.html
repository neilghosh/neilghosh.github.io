I just bought bought a Samsung netbook (<a href="http://www.samsung.com/in/consumer/pc-peripherals-printer/notebook/netbook/NP-NC108-A04IN/index.idx?pagetype=prd_detail" target="_blank">NP-NC108-A04IN</a>). Like many of the netbooks of this price range it came with <a href="http://www.freedos.org/" target="_blank">FreeDOS. </a>Few price comparison revealed that the same model with Windows 7 basic license  costs  on an average 2500/- INR more that that of the once with FreeDOS.<br/><br/><a href="http://neilghosh.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/2011-08-13-23.40.47.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-822" title="2011-08-13 23.40.47" src="http://neilghosh.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/2011-08-13-23.40.47-1024x768.jpg" alt="" width="645" height="483" /></a><br/><br/>While buying I was assuming that it must have boot from USB feature, otherwise it is very difficult to install operating systems like Windows or Linux without any optical drive. I could install Windows XP with the following steps.<br/><ol><br/>	<li>Downloaded <a href="http://wintoflash.com/download/en/" target="_blank">WInToFlash</a></li><br/>	<li>Create the Windows XP ISO image file from the CD</li><br/>	<li>Use <a href="http://www.techtipsgeek.com/install-windows-from-usb-flash-pen-drive/559/" target="_blank">this</a> guide to make a USB drive bootable with windows XP image.</li><br/>	<li>Now change the boot sequence of the notebook such that the USB drive takes preference over the internal hard disk (Where freeDOS is installed)<br/><br/><a href="http://neilghosh.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/2011-08-13-23.41.291.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-828" title="2011-08-13 23.41.29" src="http://neilghosh.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/2011-08-13-23.41.291-1024x768.jpg" alt="" width="645" height="483" /></a></li><br/>	<li>Boot from the USB drive.</li><br/>	<li>Select the 1st Option in the following screen<br/><a href="http://neilghosh.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/2011-08-13-23.41.59.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-818" title="2011-08-13 23.41.59" src="http://neilghosh.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/2011-08-13-23.41.59-1024x768.jpg" alt="" width="645" height="483" /></a></li><br/>	<li>Continue with a fresh installation. Make sure you select a different location than the default one (which is the USB drive itself ). Typically you should select the Drive C: The first steps will be as usual text based installation.</li><br/>	<li>Windows setup will copy the files. For me this process was extremely slow. The reason is still unknown. It took whole evening to do so. SO have patience.</li><br/>	<li>After it reboots automatically , Now it should be booted again from the pen drive but this time select the 2nd option as follows<br/><a href="http://neilghosh.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/2011-08-13-23.42.07.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-820" title="2011-08-13 23.42.07" src="http://neilghosh.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/2011-08-13-23.42.07-1024x768.jpg" alt="" width="645" height="483" /></a></li><br/>	<li>Continue the graphical installation till it reboots again.</li><br/>	<li>Now windows  will start for the 1st time and as per documentation this time also it should be booted with the 2nd option like the previous step.</li><br/>	<li>After completing the start up Remove the USB drive and you are done.</li><br/>	<li>Optionally you can revert your boot sequence back.</li><br/></ol><br/>I am also planning to have dual boot in the netbook with Ubuntu . This can be done using <a href="http://www.pendrivelinux.com/downloads/Universal-USB-Installer/Universal-USB-Installer.exe" target="_blank">pendrivelinux</a>.<br/><br/>&nbsp;<br/><br/>&nbsp;
