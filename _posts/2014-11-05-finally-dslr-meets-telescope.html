<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"><div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"><div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">After prolonged resistance for buying a DSLR, I finally got a Canon EOS 600D it. The main reason was not probably photography. I have done enough photography using my point and shoot camera <a href="http://www.neilghosh.com/2011/10/sony-cyber-shot-hx9v.html" target="_blank">Sony CyberShot HX9V</a>. It not only had a decent zoom of 16x but also very portable enough to carry in a jeans pocket. The reason why avoided was that it itself is a luggage when you travel. Secondly I was afraid of tuning into yet another IT employee claiming/wannabe professional photographer for whom a Photoshopped stray dog picture from DSLR becomes "Wile Life Photography".<br /><br />Anyway I had to buy an DSLR someday to connect my telescopes to it and get some long exposure. I have done afocal photography earlier by keeping the point and shoot camera in front of the eyepiece but one can not get a long exposure in the method unless you use another tripod and OK with trails.<br /><br />The preparation began when I went to USA last time where I got a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002UEE136" target="_blank">telescope motor</a> which can keep my alt-azimuth mount moving and cancelling effect of earth's rotation. I also bought a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000237C9M/" target="_blank">T-ring</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000665V6/" target="_blank">adapter</a> , one end of which can screw into a DSLR body and other end can go into the eyepiece holder of the telescope. All these things are not easily available in India.<br /><br />Finally since it was winter I went for a DSLR and there was a couple of reason for looking into only Canon. Firstly the T-ring adapter thread was canon EOS comparable. Secondly most of my friends had Canon EOS , so I could exchange gears with them. Otherwise Nikon D5200 seemed to be a good deal in that price. Even the mirror less cameras like EOS M are really handy.<br /><br />Here are the picture I shot last week after hooking up the DLSR body on to my telescope. Looks like I have to focus more precisely using the telescope knob after digitally zooming in the live view.<br /><br /></div><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="427" mozallowfullscreen="" msallowfullscreen="" oallowfullscreen="" src="https://www.flickr.com/photos/neilghosh/15691601481/in/set-72157628188007685/player/" webkitallowfullscreen="" width="640"></iframe></div><br /><div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><object width="320" height="266" class="BLOGGER-youtube-video" classid="clsid:D27CDB6E-AE6D-11cf-96B8-444553540000" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0" data-thumbnail-src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/nvPA2uZXhX4/0.jpg"><param name="movie" value="https://www.youtube.com/v/nvPA2uZXhX4?version=3&f=user_uploads&c=google-webdrive-0&app=youtube_gdata" /><param name="bgcolor" value="#FFFFFF" /><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" /><embed width="640" height="480"  src="https://www.youtube.com/v/nvPA2uZXhX4?version=3&f=user_uploads&c=google-webdrive-0&app=youtube_gdata" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowfullscreen="true"></embed></object></div><br /><br />Notice the sound of the motor stops somewhere in the midway and the moon slowly starts to get out of the field of view.<br /><br />In the coming days as I get more clear skies, I will try to capture the constellations and&nbsp; brighter deep sky objects.</div></div>
