Last weekend was spent at one of the beaches in the east coast of India next to Bay of Bengal called Suryalanka. We decided to drive this time. We took the newly constructed Outer Ring Road of Hyderabad and then National Highway 9 to Vijaywada to make sure drive is pleasant.<br/><iframe src="https://maps.google.com/maps/ms?msid=214778165466350903712.0004d2c0a91a7c2e3f919&amp;msa=0&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;t=m&amp;ll=16.646718,79.398193&amp;spn=2.526026,3.515625&amp;z=8&amp;output=embed" height="462" width="616" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe><br/><small>View <a style="color: #0000ff; text-align: left;" href="https://maps.google.com/maps/ms?msid=214778165466350903712.0004d2c0a91a7c2e3f919&amp;msa=0&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;t=m&amp;ll=16.646718,79.398193&amp;spn=2.526026,3.515625&amp;z=8&amp;source=embed">Suryalanka Driving Trip</a> in a larger map<br/></small><br/><br/>There was one more alternate way via Nalgonda which is about 30 KM shorter but we decided to stick to the road which has dividers all the way till Guntur. We had to pay a sum of INR 300 as part of toll in each side of JourneyÂ  but I think it was worth it. took us around 9 hours to reach the destination (420KM) including an hour break and a 30 minutes traffic jam at Vijayawada while entering NH5. Otherwise the average speed was very good. While going from Vijayawada to Guntur we took the Tadepalli Trunk road short cut which did not have dividers but we stuck to NH5 while coming back. Also there is something wrong with Google Maps , which shows a longer path near Kodad instead of following the NH. Probably the route map is not updated with latest imagery which have the highway construction completed.<br/><br/>There are couple of more places near to this place which I have got good reviews<br/><ol><br/>	<li>Chirala Beach ( There is a <a href="ttp://www.seabreeze-beachresorts.com/home.html" target="_blank">private resort</a> )</li><br/>	<li>Bhawani Island (Can be booked through <a href="http://aptdc.in/booking/booking.php" target="_blank">APTDC</a> website , use Internet Explorer )</li><br/></ol><br/><object width="625" height="469" classid="clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0"><param name="flashvars" value="offsite=true&amp;lang=en-us&amp;page_show_url=%2Fphotos%2Fneilghosh%2Fsets%2F72157632529145488%2Fshow%2F&amp;page_show_back_url=%2Fphotos%2Fneilghosh%2Fsets%2F72157632529145488%2F&amp;set_id=72157632529145488&amp;jump_to=" /><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" /><param name="src" value="http://www.flickr.com/apps/slideshow/show.swf?v=124984" /><param name="allowfullscreen" value="true" /><embed width="625" height="469" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" src="http://www.flickr.com/apps/slideshow/show.swf?v=124984" flashvars="offsite=true&amp;lang=en-us&amp;page_show_url=%2Fphotos%2Fneilghosh%2Fsets%2F72157632529145488%2Fshow%2F&amp;page_show_back_url=%2Fphotos%2Fneilghosh%2Fsets%2F72157632529145488%2F&amp;set_id=72157632529145488&amp;jump_to=" allowFullScreen="true" allowfullscreen="true" /></object>
