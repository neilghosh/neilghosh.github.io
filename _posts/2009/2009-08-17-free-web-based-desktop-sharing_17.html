<p>I am one of those who like instant desktop sharing for free without installing any software or configuring user account at the target PC.   <br />This may sound bit greedy but I found some good solutions to it.</p>  <p>1. Adobe <a href="http://connectnow.acrobat.com/" target="_blank">ConnectNow</a>.I fond it most real time and fast and smooth if there is a broadband connection.</p>  <p>2.Web site <a href="http://vyew.com/" target="_blank">Vyew</a> (think view) lets you collaborate in real-time with other users in a web based meeting room.You can either start an anonymous meeting (requires no registration) and invite up to 2 users, or, if you go through the free registration, you can invite up to 20 participants and get a few other members-only benefits. Vyew offers photo sharing, whiteboarding, file sharing, screen captures, and can run from your browser without the need to download anything (sort of). Vyew requires Flash and Java.</p>  <p>3.<a href="https://meeting.zoho.com" target="_blank">Zoho Meeting</a> is one of large number of free collaboration tools which does not need any extra installation.</p>  <p>&#160;</p>  <table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="2" width="400"><tbody>     <tr>       <td valign="top" width="200"><a href="http://connectnow.acrobat.com/"><img src="http://www.adobe.com/acom/connectnow/images/screen_sharing_180x170.jpg" /></a> </td>        <td valign="top" width="200">         <br />&#160;<a href="http://vyew.com/" target="_blank"><img src="http://vyew.com/site/images/uploads/cbox-present.png" /></a></td>     </tr>      <tr>       <td valign="top" width="200"><a href="https://meeting.zoho.com" target="_blank"><img src="https://meeting.zoho.com/images/meeting_logo1.gif" /></a> </td>        <td valign="top" width="200"><a href="http://www.gotomypc.com/" target="_blank"><img src="https://www.gotomypc.com/images/branding/personal/logo_202x50.gif" /></a> </td>     </tr>   </tbody></table>  <p>However beside above these free tools I find Oracle Web conference most real time and efficient tool for desktop sharing.</p>  <p>Among paid services&#160; <a href="http://www.gotomypc.com/" target="_blank">GoToMyPC</a> is the right solution if you are into small business and want the best productivity using screen sharing.</p>
