<p>I have been following TED since last year when I saw the talk by the Google guys.It was really inspiring with practical examples.    <br />TED was here in India at the Mysore campus of Infosys Tech India.Here is the flickr slide show</p> <a href="http://www.flickr.com/apps/slideshow/show.swf?v=71649">http://www.flickr.com/apps/slideshow/show.swf?v=71649</a>  <p>The (official) video recordings of TED India sessions arenâ€™t available yet (except that of <a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/pranav_mistry_the_thrilling_potential_of_sixthsense_technology.html">Pranav Mistry</a>) but you can subscribe to <a href="http://www.ted.com/themes/new_on_ted_com.html">this page</a> and get notified as soon as new TED videos are posted online.Here is the 4 minute summery report </p> <a href="http://www.youtube.com/v/07dnzCd3ff0&#038;rel=0&#038;color1=d6d6d6&#038;color2=f0f0f0&#038;border=0&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en&#038;autoplay=0&#038;showinfo=0&#038;iv_load_policy=3&#038;showsearch=0&#038;hd=1&#038;start=166">http://www.youtube.com/v/07dnzCd3ff0&#038;rel=0&#038;color1=d6d6d6&#038;color2=f0f0f0&#038;border=0&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en&#038;autoplay=0&#038;showinfo=0&#038;iv_load_policy=3&#038;showsearch=0&#038;hd=1&#038;start=166</a>
