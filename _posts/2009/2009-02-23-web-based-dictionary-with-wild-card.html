Have you ever wondered whay if you know a few of the letters of the word and dont know the exact spelling ? <a href="http://www.wordwaldo.com/" target="_blank">WordWaldo</a> lets you  search for words by starting, ending or in-between characters.The wildcard feature supports * for 0 or more letters, and - for a single letter.  For example, <strong>h-ll</strong> matches hull or hell, while <strong>*meter</strong> matches all words that end with “meter” including the word metre itself.
