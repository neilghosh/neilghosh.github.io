Image stacking in Astrophotography used for capturing a lot of photos of dark/faint objects in the sky and super imposing it on top of each other 
in such a way that the object aligns with each other and making the resultant image brighter and sharper. Typically a night sky image is capture with a
long exposure i.e. lower shutter speed (probably more than 1 second for planets and 5 second for starry sky) to capture more light otherwise faint stars 
and any other non-lit object in the foreground like tree in the night time won't even register in camera's sensor. This is also done along with a hight ISO setting 
like 1600 and above. A wider aparture also helps gathering more light. Something like lower value of f stop f/3.6.
