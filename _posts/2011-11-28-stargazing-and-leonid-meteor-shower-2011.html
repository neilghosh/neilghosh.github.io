It had been a while I bought a couple of telescopes but I had not used it outdoors yet. I had been using them only from my building terrace which is full of light pollution. I wanted to go out , at least with the small table top telescope. With encouragement from couple of my friends <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/Srini_Mothay" target="_blank">Srini </a>and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/lsprasath" target="_blank">LSP</a> we went to a nearby place where sky was relatively dark and one could see stars up to magnitude +4.5 (Naked eye limit in the darkest sky is about 6). This was just enough to see the the couple of stars (mu And and nu And) in Taurus which can be used to locate the M31 (Andromeda Galaxy, the only naked eye object outside our milky way ). We reached around 11pm on 17th Jan at the <a href="http://g.co/maps/e39fd" target="_blank">spot</a>. I was expecting the moonrise at 12 midnight but to my surprise, the horizon was so low (we were at a higher place) that moon appeared at 11.30 itself. It was large and orange colored. We started setting up telescopes quickly to avoid moon light glare in sky. We only spotted very few objects as it was 1st session of this kind.<br/><br/>LSP immediately got busy shooting moon with his excellent photography skills and professional camera and lenses. Here is a 10 minutes exposure photo taken by him. All of us appear as faint shadows  as we kept moving around , in front of the camera<br/><br/>[caption id="" align="alignnone" width="960" caption="A long exposure photograph for 10 minutes. One can see our setup of telescopes and the rising moon in the background. I guess the trails in the top right are produced by the stars of the Orion constellation."]<a href="https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.10150951355755693.767549.881995692&amp;type=3"><img src="https://fbcdn-sphotos-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-snc7/378631_10150951356235693_881995692_21705379_1174981596_n.jpg" alt="" width="960" height="641" /></a>[/caption]<br/><br/>We looked at Moon,  Jupiter , four of its moon , Orion Nebula , M45 through the telescope with various magnification e.g. 50X and 125X, 225X using various eyepiece. Everybody except me were lucky enough to see some meteors of annual leonid shower also. I managed to take some long exposure photos of Orion , Canis Major , Canis Minor , Persius Taurus and Cassiopea.<br/><br/><object width="600" height="400" classid="clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0"><param name="src" value="https://picasaweb.google.com/s/c/bin/slideshow.swf" /><param name="flashvars" value="host=picasaweb.google.com&amp;captions=1&amp;hl=en_US&amp;feat=flashalbum&amp;RGB=0x000000&amp;feed=https%3A%2F%2Fpicasaweb.google.com%2Fdata%2Ffeed%2Fapi%2Fuser%2Fneil.ghosh%2Falbumid%2F5679771977287229649%3Falt%3Drss%26kind%3Dphoto%26hl%3Den_US" /><param name="pluginspage" value="http://www.macromedia.com/go/getflashplayer" /><embed width="600" height="400" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" src="https://picasaweb.google.com/s/c/bin/slideshow.swf" flashvars="host=picasaweb.google.com&amp;captions=1&amp;hl=en_US&amp;feat=flashalbum&amp;RGB=0x000000&amp;feed=https%3A%2F%2Fpicasaweb.google.com%2Fdata%2Ffeed%2Fapi%2Fuser%2Fneil.ghosh%2Falbumid%2F5679771977287229649%3Falt%3Drss%26kind%3Dphoto%26hl%3Den_US" pluginspage="http://www.macromedia.com/go/getflashplayer" /></object><br/><br/>We also tried some afocal photography with highest magnification. LSP was successful in taking a very sharp picture of moon and its craters after several attempts.<br/><br/>[caption id="" align="alignnone" width="960" caption="This is by far the closest I&#39;ve seen of our Moon.

Then the red planet Mars rose very close to Regulus (brightest star in Leo).
