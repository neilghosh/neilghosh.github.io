Few months back I registered at NASA's <a href="http://spotthestation.nasa.gov/" target="_blank">sport the station website </a>which sends me an email reminder every time ISS (International Space Station) is visible from my city and visible through naked eye. Though I have seen it earlier accidentally, I have always missed the timings send through the reminder. Either I was too lazy to wake up early or late from work in the evening. Yesterday I got the following email reminder.<br/><blockquote>SpotTheStation! Time: Sun Dec 09 6:21 PM, Visible: 4 min, Max Height: 40 degrees, Appears: W, Disappears: NNE</blockquote><br/>It was not very dark at this time but it rose from the western as predicted and was bit reddish as compared to the other bright stars visible at that time. It was probably as bright as Venus.<br/><br/><a href="http://neilghosh.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/ISS.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1350" title="ISS" src="http://neilghosh.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/ISS.png" alt="" width="560" height="482" /></a><br/><br/>I was not well equipped so just managed to click this quickly moving object at 16X zoom and got the following image. One can notice the wings in it.<br/><p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://neilghosh.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/DSC06544.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-1351" title="DSC06544" src="http://neilghosh.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/DSC06544.jpg" alt="" width="605" height="421" /></a></p><br/>Probably next time I will carry a tripod and capture a trail. Even my binocular should be enough to reveal the wings.
