<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">The Ashes season of this year ended. Glad that England re-gained it. Not because I am a Aussie hater (like most Indians because of Australian aggressiveness and domination in the past ) but because they have been playing really good lately. Youngsters like Joe Root is now # 1 batsman in ICC rankings.<br /><br />Since last couple of months or so I have been enjoying the cricket broadcast on the Radio (BBC 5 live extra with Tunnel Bear VPN app for UK ) and TV (also star sports online streaming ). This is usually the most interesting series for me because of classic English commentary and playing conditions. Of course I am more alert when India tours England and Australia but there is something about these two countries' rivalry.<br /><br />I will miss the commentary of Nasser Hussain and Michael Atherton. (Coincidentally they were born only 3 days apart ) I think they are the most accent free and speak slow. While Cris Rogers and Pup decided to retire after this series legendary wicket keeper run machine Kumar Sangakkara is also playing his last series in Sri Lanka against India.<br /><br />Happy for Alister Cook, what a summer it has been after being left out in world cup early this year. All matches had results this year and tough all the matches were won with a big margin it has been a great contest with 3-2 result.<br /><br /></div>
