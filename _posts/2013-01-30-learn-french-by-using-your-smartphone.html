Last week I posted about the <a title="English 2020 Launched !" href="http://neilghosh.com/2012/12/22/english-2020-launched/">English-2020 project</a> for improving spoken English world wide and I was also playing around my mobile phone. With the mobile version of English-2020 coming in next few months I came across this <a href="http://en.partypoker.fr/" target="_blank">interesting site for learning french</a>. Below is a partner post about this site and their apps. I always wanted to learn, hope you find it useful.<br/><br/>The French language is one of the most widely spoken languages in the world. There are currently more than 129 million people that <a href="http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=French+Language" target="_blank">speak French</a> and 70 million of that are native speakers according to a study made by the European Union. This number is expected to increase up to 500 million in 2025 according to Agence universitaire de la Francophonie (AUF) and Laval University. Some study French because it is required in school and some learn this language to impress someone. Hearing someone talk in French, especially the likes of Olivier Martinez and Audrey Tatou, is a major turn on for most men and women. There is something sexy about this language that attracts people. Years ago, the only way to learn French is by going to a language school. With today’s technology, you can now learn this language by using your smartphone. Here are some Android applications that can come in handy when learning French:<br/><br/><strong>PartyPoker France</strong><br/>Who says that learning French can be boring? You can actually have fun playing poker and at the same time learn this language. You can either visit the <a href="http://www.partypoker.fr/">Partypoker.fr</a> website or download its application in your Android phone. If you know the poker terms, then it will be easier for you to translate what’s on the website. If you are not familiar with them, then you can always click the Google translation on top of your browser. Since poker is mostly about numbers, then you only need to learn a few important terms including Full aux As (Aces Full), Miser le Pot (Bet the Pot), and Cart Ouverte (Open card). Once you have mastered those terms, then you can compete with the other French opponents at PartyPoker. There are different kinds of tournaments available in this poker site, which makes it more fun and exciting. You can also join in anytime you want because the games here run 24/7. Joining this game is a win-win situation because you won’t only have fun playing poker and learn basic French, but also get a chance to win huge cash.<br/><br/><strong>French Translator/Dictionary</strong><br/>This application from GreenLife Apps is perfect for those who want to learn short French sentences. You can type an English sentence and it automatically translates it to French. Or you can type a French sentence so you will know what that means in English. Aside from translating English to French and vice-versa, you will also get a new word each day which you can add to your French vocabulary. The <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.greenleaf.android.translator.enfr.c">French Translator/Dictionary</a> also gives sentences on how to use that word.<br/><br/><strong>BabelFish Voice: French</strong><br/>French words are quite difficult to pronounce because how it is written is sometimes different from how you say it. Thanks to <a href="http://www.appbrain.com/app/babelfish-voice%3A-french/com.vandroid.babelFishVoiceEngToFrench">BabelFish Voice: French</a>, you can now learn how to correctly say the words written in French. This application gives voice translation so all you have to do is speak into the microphone and get a spoken French translation. This will spare you from speaking funny French.<br/><br/><img class="alignnone" alt="" src="http://1.androidauthority.com/wp-content/uploads/howto/best-android-apps-learning-french-babelfish-voice-french-120615.jpg" width="627" height="365" /><br/><br/>The above site has about 38,000 daily visitors <a href="http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=Partypoker.fr+&amp;a=*C.Partypoker!.fr-_*Internet-" target="_blank">according to wolframalpha</a>.
