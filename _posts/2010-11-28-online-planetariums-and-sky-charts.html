<p>When its a cloudy night and wrong season to see your favorite star , you might want to quickly look at a computer software's which emulates the sky. The 1st software I had seen back in my college days was <a href="http://www.cybersky.com/" target="_blank">CyberSky</a>. Since then it has added so many futures that I can not even imagine. Since then I had never checked this because I got some alternative open source software like&#160; <a href="http://www.openuniverse.org/" target="_blank">Open Universe</a> and <a href="http://www.shatters.net/celestia/" target="_blank">Celestia</a>. Both were pretty good but were little but heavy&#160; because of their focus on 3D simulation of all the celestial objects.</p>  <p>Later when my interest switched from fun watching planetary animations to serious stargazing and watching clusters and comets I picked up software specialist in in sky-watching like&#160; <a href="http://stellarium">stellarium</a> and <a href="http://www.ap-i.net/skychart/start" target="_blank">Cartes-du-Ceil</a>. </p>  <p>However there are few websites&#160; which delivers interactive sky maps right in your browser.</p>  <p>1. <a href="http://www.worldwidetelescope.org/" target="_blank">worldwidetelescope</a> [Needs Microsoft Silverlight ]</p>  <p>2. <a href="http://www.google.com/sky/" target="_blank">Google Sky</a> (Google Earth is better )</p>  <p>3. <a href="http://www.neave.com/planetarium/" target="_blank">neave planetarium</a></p>  <p>4. <a href="http://skychart.skytonight.com/observing/skychart/skychartlaunch.asp" target="_blank">Sky and Telescope</a> [Java applet]</p>  <p>5. <a href="http://www.astroviewer.com/interactive-night-sky-map.php" target="_blank">Astro Viewer</a> [Java Applet]</p>  <p>6. <a href="http://www.sky-map.org/" target="_blank">sky-map.org</a> [Google Sky like interface]</p>  <p>7.<a href="http://www.skyviewcafe.com/skyview.php" target="_blank">Sky View Cafe</a> [Java applet ] </p>
