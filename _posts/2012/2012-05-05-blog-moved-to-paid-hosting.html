My <a title="Back to WordPress" href="http://neilghosh.com/2011/07/23/back-to-wordpress/">free hosting service</a> just went down yesterday and  I am sorry of you encountered 404 error while visiting my blog. I decided to move to Godaddy.com's linux hosting service. It has been quite reliable since I have bought the domain name around four years back.<br/><br/><a target="_blank" href="http://affiliate.godaddy.com/redirect/991FA1EA1439AE737BCF34061A8B6125D5F645ECFE4C9DC72D8909919C2F3B2EC5631D32CFBFBD58E8DAA0DAD2600E73299BBE95FD20F18A2607388A9A4C3C0C"><img src="http://affiliate.godaddy.com/ads/991FA1EA1439AE737BCF34061A8B6125D5F645ECFE4C9DC72D8909919C2F3B2EC5631D32CFBFBD58E8DAA0DAD2600E73299BBE95FD20F18A2607388A9A4C3C0C" border="0" width="120"  height="60" alt="Go Daddy - The Worlds #1 Domain Registrar!"/></a><br/><br/>I am quite excited to use its SSH feature and web programming in other language like python and perl. However I still have a DNS cache problem with my ISP and not able to open my own blog without a VPN service. The cached  DNS still points to the old website (Which is eventually up but I don't care any more ).
