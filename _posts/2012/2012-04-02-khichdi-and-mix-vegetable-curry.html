When I started my blog I was supposed to be about technology tips and How Tos . However it has taken many direction from there. One of the reason which motivates me writing posts about everything is that it may work as a diary which can remind me thing which I have learned over the years without really having to be dependent on anybody else. The following is one of the very few dishes I know.<br/><br/>Steps to prepare <strong><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khichdi" target="_blank"><em>Khichdi</em> </a>and Mix vegetable Curry</strong><br/><ol><br/>	<li>Take two clips of rice and one cup of yellow <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mung_bean" target="_blank"><em>Mung Daal</em></a> and wash them with water few times.</li><br/>	<li>Keep them in the pressure cooker with four to five cups of water and half spoon of salt.</li><br/>	<li>Wait till two whistles.</li><br/>	<li>For <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaunk" target="_blank">Tadka/Chaunk </a></em> take two spoons of <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghee" target="_blank">Ghee </a></em>and one spoon of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cumin" target="_blank"><em>Jeera</em>/Cumin</a></li><br/>	<li>Fry till the smell of cooked <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cumin" target="_blank"><em>Jeera</em>/Cumin</a> comes and add them to cooked rice and mix.</li><br/>	<li>Chop Tomato , Cauliflower , Onions, Carrot  and Potato mix them with  Frozen Peas, Corn and Chillies</li><br/>	<li>Take a pan and add two/three spoons of oil, one spoon of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cumin" target="_blank"><em>Jeera</em>/Cumin</a>,  two spoon of Ginger and Garlic paste and sauté them.</li><br/>	<li>Sauté onions and green chillies.</li><br/>	<li>Add all the vegetables except Tomatoes and Capsicums.</li><br/>	<li>Mix and cover it for two to three minutes.</li><br/>	<li>Add three/fourth spoon of salt , mix all the vegetables.</li><br/>	<li>Finally Add tomatoes and capsicum</li><br/>	<li>Also add Turmeric, Coriander powder and  red Chilli powder</li><br/>	<li>Mix everything and cover it for ten minutes in medium heat.</li><br/>	<li>Take spatula and try to cut the vegetable with minimum force to check if they are cooked completely</li><br/>	<li>If it cuts then stop cooking else continue for few more minutes and check again.</li><br/>	<li>In the end garnish with coriander leaves</li><br/></ol><br/>That is all for now.
