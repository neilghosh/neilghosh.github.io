Ever since childhood I have been of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rabindra_Sangeet" target="_blank">Rabindra Sangeet</a>. Recently I came across couple of Bangla movie songs based on vary famous songs written by Nobel Laureate <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rabindranath_Tagore" target="_blank">Rabindranath Tagore.</a> One can say it is kind of revival of traditional Rabindra Sangeet. Both are sang by famous Bengali singer <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Somlata_Acharyya_Chowdhury" target="_blank">Somlata</a><br/><br/>.<br/><br/><iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/1aGwOBgyWTo" frameborder="0" width="560" height="315"></iframe><br/><iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/rZ44jz2mb3o" frameborder="0" width="560" height="315"></iframe><br/><br/>Also not to forget the famous video<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlfKdbWwruY" target="_blank"> Where the Hell is Matt? 2008</a>, in which the music was given by Garry Schyman based on lyrics of Rabindra Sangeet.
