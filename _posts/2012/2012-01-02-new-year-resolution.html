Its strange how the permalink of the post was generated and completely changed the meaning. I neither celebrated new year's day nor thought about resolution . I did not celebrate because<a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2012/01/01/another-orbit-why-you-dont-look-a-rotation-older-than-4-56-billion-years/"> it is not the only way to mark or measure the "new year"</a> and no resolution (reminds me old joke about resolution of 800x600) because its never to late or early to change your habits. One should do it right away.<br/><br/>But celebration is good, especially for those who just need a chance to celebrate , whatever may be the reason.
