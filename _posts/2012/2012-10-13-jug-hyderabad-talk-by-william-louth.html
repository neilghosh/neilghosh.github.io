Last month <a href="http://www.meetup.com/hydjug/events/77143642/" target="_blank">JUG Hyderaba</a>d had a session by <a href="https://twitter.com/WilliamLouth" target="_blank">William Louth</a>. He introduced a really new paradigm of optimizing JVM performance in his session with title "JVM Performance - Past, Present and Predicted". This session was hosted in Oracle India's Hyderabad development center. Not to forget that the snacks were sponsored by JUG leader Ravi <a href="http://www.meetup.com/hydjug/members/46352412/">Ravi Buddharaju</a> and tea by me. Unfortunately like <a title="Official Java User Group Hyderabad â€“ Kickoff Meeting" href="http://neilghosh.com/2012/05/25/official-java-user-group-hyderabad-kickoff-meeting/" target="_blank">last time</a> most of the people who RSVP'ed Yes were not professional enough let us know that they weren't coming. As a result some of the logistics effort went for a toss. Meetup.com has a option to mark "no shows" which ultimately effects the credibility of the person's RSVP, which can be used to decided if they should be allowed in the events where they are in wait list. Anyway I am thankful to all the attendees who too their time out and reached the venue in time. Looking forward to a growing JUG in Hyderabad. Last but not the least thanks a lot to William who came all the way to India and spoke in thsi event. Somehow he reminds me <a href="http://www.espncricinfo.com/newzealand/content/player/37737.html" target="_blank">Brendon McCullum</a> :)<br/><a href="http://s1116.beta.photobucket.com/user/neilghosh/library/blog%20images" target="_blank"><img src="http://i1116.photobucket.com/albums/k579/neilghosh/blog%20images/Jug_zps3b9d2316.jpeg" alt="JUG Hyderabad" border="0" /></a>
