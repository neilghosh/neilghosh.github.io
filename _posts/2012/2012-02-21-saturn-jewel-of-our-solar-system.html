Last summer when Saturn used to be at its best , high in sky I looked at it for the 1st time through a telescope and I was blown away by the beauty of its rings. This is a dream come true for any kid who wants to be an astronomer. It was like a milestone.  Yesterday I was doing a stargazing session and pointed my telescope at the rising Saturn again . It was a bit faint but I could not resist seeing in my own eyes again. It was about magnitude 0.7 yesterday.<br/><br/>I was using my Orion 90mm StarMax Table top due to lack of man power for carrying the large telescope. I used an eyepiece of 10mm to get magnification about 125X. Rings were very sharp and probably I also figured out the Cassini division. I could not locate the 9.7 magnitude Titan because it was near horizon and city light was blocking it.<br/><br/>I don't  have the adapter for A-Focal photography yet but I took multiple shots with my digital camera succeeded in few of them and the sharpest I could take is as follows . I got this picture with ISO 1600, Exposure 1/40 and Aperture 3.3 and focus set to infinity.<br/><a title="Saturn on 18 FEB 2012 by neilghosh, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/neilghosh/6901389183/"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7050/6901389183_e47d1faa38_z.jpg" alt="Saturn on 18 FEB 2012" width="640" height="419" /></a><br/><a title="Mars and Rising Saturn by neilghosh, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/neilghosh/6901393337/"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7051/6901393337_1a35113b20_z.jpg" alt="Mars and Rising Saturn" width="640" height="480" /></a><br/><br/>The above picture covers Mars at the top in Leo and Saturn at the bottom in Virgo, I will post the annotated one soon.
