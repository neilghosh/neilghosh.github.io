Featured post in <a href="http://googledevelopers.blogspot.in/2012/11/devfest-season-in-final-stretch.html" target="_blank">Google Developer Blog</a><br/><br/>I got an invitation to speak at <a href="http://hyd.devfest.info/" target="_blank">Google Devfest 2012 at Hyderabad</a> last Saturday. I was supposed to speak on HTML5. Google is a leading company who promote HTML5 and implement features in Chrome much ahead of time before specifications are freezes.<br/><br/><a href="http://neilghosh.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/552259_550392241653798_417646036_n.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-1318" title="552259_550392241653798_417646036_n" src="http://neilghosh.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/552259_550392241653798_417646036_n.jpg" alt="" width="613" height="450" /></a>Photo Credit : Abhinav Saxena.<br/><br/>I created some html slides with the help of<a href="slides.html5rocks.com" target="_blank"> html5rocks.com</a> slides using impress.js. Advantage of this over conventional powerpoint/open office was that I could embed the demos inline as these slides were also running on HTML5 compatible browser. Though Mozilla Firefox is my personal favorite , I used chrome to display the slides because a. I was going to a Google community event b. APIs like speech recognition works only in chrome.<br/><br/>Some of the demo did not run in chrome when the html page was run locally with file:// protocol in the URL as chrome though this is not a valid domain. For <a href="http://neilghosh.com/events/gdg-html5/#/geolocation" target="_blank">geolocation </a>and <a href="http://neilghosh.com/events/gdg-html5/#/webworkers" target="_blank">webworker demos</a> I had to host the html slides in a local webserver. The simplest way to start a webserver in windows I found was to use Python's built in http server. I just typed the following<br/><blockquote>python -m http.server</blockquote><br/>And that's it. It started a html server at port 8000. I also hosted the slides in <a href="https://dl.dropbox.com/u/655237/events/gdg-html5" target="_blank">dropbox </a>and <a href="http://neilghosh.com/events/gdg-html5" target="_blank">my own domain</a> for backup and to allow the audience to use it later.<br/><br/>I had got only 30 minutes to speak but again asked to reduce to 15 to 20 minutes as event was running late and there was a hard stop time from the logistics prospective. I have never seen any Indian event running on time even if it is organized by a big corporation. Usually the time is compensated by trimming the break time which is sometimes very important in events like this from the developer's networking perspective. I have seen some of the events like <a title="JavaOne and Oracle Develope 2012 Hyderabad" href="http://neilghosh.com/2012/05/06/javaone-and-oracle-develope-2012-hyderabad/" target="_blank">JavaOne Hyderabad</a> had dedicated hangout time which was very productive.<br/><br/>Anyway while I understand the devfest organizer had no choice but to cut short the last session which was unfortunately mine . However I managed to start the session early at the scheduled time without waiting much for the audience to come back from the tea session. I also ran through the slides quite fast to make few minutes available for the vote of thanks :)<br/><br/>I am really thankful to <a href="https://plus.google.com/105634398120660493413/posts" target="_blank">Bharat </a>(Community manager of <a href="http://www.gtugs.org/chapter.jsp?id=20" target="_blank">Google Developer group Hyderabad</a> ),Â Bhumika Kaushik and <a href="https://plus.google.com/112561817891178051094/posts" target="_blank">Uttam Tripathy</a> from Google for the opportunity and fix my slot according to my convenience.<br/><br/>I wish I could attend the other sessions in the morning and afternoon but I was caught up with some work. All other speakers were very young (much younger than even me :) ) and talented in their areas. I also met a lot of students from the colleges around Hyderabad whom I had interacted before during IEEE events.<br/><br/>I received a cute Android thumb drive and a nice T-shirt. Looking forward to more activities from the local GDG.<br/><br/><a href="http://neilghosh.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/CameraZOOM-20121103185518835.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-1319" title="CameraZOOM-20121103185518835" src="http://neilghosh.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/CameraZOOM-20121103185518835.jpg" alt="" width="599" height="454" /></a><br/><br/>Related links<br/><ul><br/>	<li><a href="http://neilghosh.com/events/gdg-html5/#/intro" target="_blank">My slides</a></li><br/>	<li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/gtughyd/" target="_blank">Google Developer Group in Facebook</a></li><br/></ul>
