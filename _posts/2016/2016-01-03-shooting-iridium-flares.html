<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">Iridium flares are sudden flares reflected from one of the Iridium satellite which looks like a very bright (as bright as -8 magnitude) moving object in the sky , sometimes brighter than Venus (max magnitude - 4.7 ) . The satellite itself is very faint in the sky (around 6 magnitude ) which almost beyond naked eye limit and since they are moving fast they can not be caught in long exposure. (because light doe not fall on a single spot in the camera sensor). I have been lately addicted to spot and capture this.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/neilghosh/24040729812/in/dateposted/" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="Iridium Flare"><img alt="Iridium Flare" src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5809/24040729812_80c5969efa_c.jpg" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Iridium Flare Captured From Urban Sky</td></tr></tbody></table><script async="" charset="utf-8" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js"></script> &nbsp;These are so bright during the flare that it can be easily seen even from the most light polluted sky. Here in this photo I could only see the bright stars. I could barely see a 2.8 mag star above 10 degree of southern horizon. Thanks to heavens-above.com and its Android app I could easily notified well before the flare and track it live just before its appearance so that I can have my camera's shutter open.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-387l4smSRCI/VoljB8TymFI/AAAAAAAB298/reGhqMKanms/s1600/ha.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="640" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-387l4smSRCI/VoljB8TymFI/AAAAAAAB298/reGhqMKanms/s640/ha.png" width="360" /></a></div><br />&nbsp;This particular time it was close to horizon during flare (about 21 degree) so I could get both the earth and sky. I have even captured this closer to horizon where its very difficult to see faint objects.<br /><br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/neilghosh/23939137112/in/photostream/" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="Iridium flare"><img alt="Iridium flare" height="333" src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1577/23939137112_23704bdfbc.jpg" width="500" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Flare just 11 degree above horizon.</td><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><br /></td><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><br /></td></tr></tbody></table><script async="" charset="utf-8" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js"></script>&nbsp; In both cases sun was well below horizon and it was evening. However I could not spot or capture this just <a href="http://heavens-above.com/flaredetails.aspx?fid=3&amp;lat=17.4936&amp;lng=78.3253&amp;loc=Chanda+Nagar&amp;alt=563&amp;tz=UCTm5colon30" target="_blank">during sunset</a> despite being magnitude -6.7. It is claimed that these bright flares can be seen in the day time also but I think I did not look at the precise part of the sky due to lack of any star , may be it was just visible. I have got the video footage , probably I will play it over and over in my leisure to detect the bright moving spot.<br /><br /><b>Camera Settings </b><br /><br />Since the sky was not very dark and I had to take a long exposure (more than a minute) I had to reduce the aperture of the camera to F/8 so that not a lot of light comes inside over the period of time when shutter is open , I also minimized the ISO to 100 to make the censor less sensitive. Anyway I was shooting in RAW format so that I can play around the exposure and contrast later.<br /><br />Since these are polar satellites , they rise in north and set in south. So all the attempts I have done till now are in the similar place of the sky. I intend to capture one in the middle of dark sky with wide angle and along with some recognizable celestial object e.g. planets and bright stars in coming days. <br /><br /><br /></div>
