Lets start where I left. Satellite spotting ! . The monsoon is almost over and clear skies are not as rare as it was for last few months. Recently some of the planets have been clustering together to make conjunctions. I missed Jupiter and Venus's closest approach last month due to bad weather. Jupiter and Venus were so close that they could have been seen within the field of view of telescopes and binoculars. Apparently Venus was closer to Jupiter than Callisto, farthest of the Galilean moons.<br /><br />Christopher Becke did make an attempt from the other side of the world.</div><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><div dir="ltr" lang="en">I think I got 4 blurry Jovian moons along with the Jupiter/Venus conjunction last night.<a href="https://twitter.com/BadAstronomer">@BadAstronomer</a> <a href="https://t.co/TlzBdJ1IAF">pic.twitter.com/TlzBdJ1IAF</a></div>â€” Christopher Becke (@BeckePhysics) <a href="https://twitter.com/BeckePhysics/status/769954595703549952">August 28, 2016</a></blockquote><script async="" charset="utf-8" src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js"></script></div>I managed to catch the Saturn and Mars hovering around Scorpios. <br /><br /><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/neilghosh/29131392235/in/dateposted-public/" title="ISS and Plane"><img alt="ISS and Plane" height="238" src="https://c4.staticflickr.com/9/8377/29131392235_00f9af5173_b.jpg" width="640" />&nbsp;</a><br /><br />And an Iridium flare and ISS pass at the same time.<br /><br /><script async="" charset="utf-8" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js"></script></div><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/neilghosh/28512646833/in/dateposted-public/" title="ISS Pass SW Sky"><img alt="ISS Pass SW Sky" height="425" src="https://c2.staticflickr.com/9/8288/28512646833_72c33ea595_b.jpg" width="640" /></a><script async="" charset="utf-8" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js"></script> <a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/neilghosh/28844541370/in/dateposted-public/" title="Iridium 97 Flare"><img alt="Iridium 97 Flare" height="426" src="https://c3.staticflickr.com/9/8267/28844541370_db74478ef2_b.jpg" width="640" /></a><script async="" charset="utf-8" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js"></script></div>
