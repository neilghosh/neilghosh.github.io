Binoculars.

Yes, its not a telescope. Especially in places like India where telescopes are really expensive. Lately I have been asked a lot by my friends what is the best entry level telescope for kids ~10 years of age who are developing interest towards astronomy. I am no expert, as I myself do not have a lot of expensive gears and there a lot of content in the internet about entry level gears but I think friends reach out to me probably because I am the only one in their circle who has interest in astronomy and I sometimes show off my amateur astro photos in social media reminding them I know something. But honestly I have not got very far from begginers level too both in astronomy and astrophotograohy. 

### Developing Interest
One this is for sure, one should not just start spending on expensive gears because they can or just because its cool to show off. One should let the kid's interest and curiocity increase organically. I personally started by getting facinated by the patterns of conterlalations (before knowing that such things exists) in the night sky lying on our [Khatia](https://www.amazon.in/Khatiya-Charpoy-Manja-Indian-Bed/dp/B083KGZ5HF), especially the the "Three equidistant dots" of Orions belt. Among planets, I think I could recognize at most the Venus which is often dazzled in the evening sky.

Of course everything made sense when my uncle gave me a book ["Stargazing For Beginners" by John Mosely](https://books.google.co.in/books/about/Stargazing_for_Beginners.html?id=6Mg7OuG0100C&redir_esc=y). This had not only introduction to everything you see in sky but also detailed explanation of the physics due to which it appears or behaves in a certain way. It also has charts of night sky for different times of the year.

Its really worth spending time getting ourselves familiarised with the sky before even getting a gear, following objects may be.

* The major consterllations
  - The Great Bear (Ursa Major)

### Apps & Charts
There are so many free and cheap apps and 

### First Gears
My one word answer at the beginning of the post was Binoculars. Yes this most affordable and easy to handle gear that most of us do not realise that we can see a lot of things without even a telescope. This is of course after we
