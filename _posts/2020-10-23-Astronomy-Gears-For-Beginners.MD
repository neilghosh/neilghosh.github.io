TL;TR Binoculars.


Yes, its not a telescope. Especially in places like India where telescopes are really expensive. Lately I have been asked a lot by my friends what is the best entry level telescope for kids ~10 years of age who are developing interest towards astronomy. I am no expert, as I myself do not have a lot of expensive gears and there a lot of content in the internet about entry level gears but I think friends reach out to me probably because I am the only one in their circle who has interest in astronomy and I sometimes show off my amateur astro photos in social media reminding them I know something. But honestly I have not got very far from begginers level too both in astronomy and astrophotograohy. 

### Developing Interest
One thing is for sure, one should not just start spending on expensive gears because they can or just because its cool to show off. One should let the kid's interest and curiocity increase organically. I personally started by getting facinated by the patterns of conterlalations (before knowing that such things exists) in the night sky lying on our [Khatia](https://www.amazon.in/Khatiya-Charpoy-Manja-Indian-Bed/dp/B083KGZ5HF), especially the the "Three equidistant dots" of Orions belt. Among planets, I think I could recognize at most the Venus which is often dazzled in the evening sky.

Of course everything made sense when my uncle gave me a book ["Stargazing For Beginners" by John Mosely](https://books.google.co.in/books/about/Stargazing_for_Beginners.html?id=6Mg7OuG0100C&redir_esc=y). This had not only introduction to everything you see in sky but also detailed explanation of the physics due to which it appears or behaves in a certain way. It also has charts of night sky for different times of the year.

Its really worth spending time getting ourselves familiarised with the sky before even getting a gear, following objects may be.

* The major consterllations
  - The Great Bear (Ursa Major)
  - Orion
  - Leo
  - Gemini
  - Virgo etc.
* Planets 
  - Jupiter
  - Venus
  - Saturn (Yes you can see in nakes eye, not rings of course)
  - Mars
* Clusters * Others
  - Pleides (7 sisters)
  - Orion's Belt & Nebula
  - Polaris (The Pole Star)
    
### Apps & Charts
There are so many free and cheap apps and online charts available for easy reference for above objects and also the ones which are not easily recognizable. For example planets, although they are bright, they do not really stay at one place in the sky. So one has to track them using a chart or follow daily to instantly recognize which one is what. I have enough experience to distringuish the planets and bright stars based on their color and brightness but it took me long time.
When I got computers for the first time, two decades ago, there were not many options. There were softwares like CyberSky and OpenUniverse which came wih some tech magazine CDs.

Today there are many options.

### First Gears
My one word answer at the beginning of the post was Binoculars. Yes this most affordable and easy to handle gear that most of us do not realise that we can see a lot of things without even a telescope. A 10X50 binaculer is good enough for begenners as its not too heavy or expensive and gives enough field of view to watch the while star clister or a small constellation in a single frame. The 10X50 notation says that it maginified 10 times and has a objective lense of 50mm. Remember more it magnifies less area of sky you cover. Which is a good thing because you resolve things which are close to each other i.e. Jupiter's moons. Can also be a bad thing because you can't see them together in the field of view while watching. Diameter of the objective lense which is 50 in this case tells how much light it gathers. Of course more light it gathers it good but it becomes heavy (makes it unstable while held in hand) and expensive. While buying telescopes you may heat terms like "5 inch" and "8 inch" telescopes. Those are nothing but diameter of the objective lense or the mirror.

Things you can do with a pair of binacular.

- Jupiter's 4 brightest moons
- Andromeada galaxy
- Pleiades
- Moon's creters
- Orion nebula
- Mizar/Alcor double star in Ursha Major (Vashishtha & Arundhati)


### Intermediate Gears
Once you pretty much explore all the object that can be seen through nakes eye and binaculars and continue to have interest in other fainter objects in the sky you may consider a binocular. There is a lot of content in the internet about choosing a telescope also. This is mostly what I have already.

#### [Telescope 1](https://neilghosh.com/2011/01/assembling-and-setting-up-telescope_23.html)
Most popolar entry level ones are the Newtonian Reflector telescopes. I have a Celetron Power Seeker 127mm which has a mirror of 5 inch diameter at the back and comes with two eye pices. One with 20mm which gives 50x maginification with sharper view and other one is 4mm which gives 250X maginification and object may look bit hazy. Thats the trade-off. It also comes with a finer scope mounted on top of the telescope which is kind of a mini telescope in itself just to locate the object in the sky before you actually make sure telecope is roughly aligned and attempt to look though the main telescope. The beuty of EQ (Equitorial Mount) mount is that it has knobs (and degrees of freedom in general) which lets the telescope move only two diractions. Declination (Dec) and Right Assention (RA). Declanation is kind of fixed for an object in the sky as you point it. But you have to continously change the Right Assention of the telescope i.e. move it slowly from east to west to counter the earth's rotation so that the object in view does not go our of the field of view. To have this moved automatically some of the telescope comes with a motor which moves it very slowly so that you never have to manually adjust the direction it points to. Remember 

#### [Telescope 2](https://neilghosh.com/2011/11/orion-starmax-90mm-table-top.html)
The othere telescope I own is a Orion Maksutov-Cassegrain table top. This is a smaller one and Refractor telescope, which means it has a 90mm lense in the front also like you would imagine any telesacope should have. The special design lets it achive more effective focal length by reflexting light back and fourth in a small tube . The mount is also Alt Azimuth that means degrees are freedom are bit more intutive. one is that it can revolve around the base and another is you can move it up and down. So the movements are not a ligned with the direction of how stars and plents move in the sky (East to West, around north star). Hence we have to manually adjust everytime in both direction it goes out of field of view but its easier to pan around and locate something.
