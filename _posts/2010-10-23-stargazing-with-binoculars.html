I recently bought a Astronomical BinocularÂ  from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Celestron-SkyMaster-Binoculars-Tripod-Adapter/dp/tech-data/B00008Y0VN/" target="_blank">Amazon</a>. Initially I thought I should go for a higher powered one but later realized that this one is optimal.<br/><br/>Just about everyone associates stargazing with telescopes. But even the most experienced backyard astronomer owns binoculars. Why? One reason is that when it comes to having a quick look at the sky, it doesn't get any easier than grabbing your binos . It's as close to instant observing as you can get. The other attraction is that ordinary binoculars take in a lot more sky than most telescopes. For big-picture views. binoculars can't be beat. And there are numerous objects so big you actually need binoculars to see them at their best. <a href="http://neilghosh.files.wordpress.com/2010/10/bino.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-454 alignleft" title="Bino" src="http://neilghosh.files.wordpress.com/2010/10/bino.jpg?w=300" alt="Binocular" width="300" height="262" /></a>For beginners, there's the added appeal of low cost . Decent binoculars are much less expensive than a good starter telescope. Also, unlike telescopes, which yield images that are upside-down or mirror-reversed, the view in binoculars matches the orientation of the real world.<br/><br/>This means that the transition from unaided view to a magnified one is relatively uncomplicated. Chances are you already own binoculars. Even if they've spent the last decade buried in the back of a closet and may not have the best optics in the world, you will still see more with them than with your eyes alone.
