<p>&#160;</p>  <p>As part of my new year resolution I had slept (relatively)early on the 1st day of the new year. This gave me a chance to material a planned hiking on the early Sunday morning of 2nd day of 2011.When I woke up it was little late for watching Saturn (rise around midnight and at zenith just before sunrise) however I was quite impressed with crescent Moon and Venus. </p> <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps/ms?ie=UTF8&#038;msa=0&#038;msid=214778165466350903712.000498d59a81898067f48&#038;t=f&#038;ecpose=17.42651368,78.377261,944.13,0,44.996,0&#038;ll=17.429836,78.377261&#038;spn=0.001459,0.003214&#038;output=embed">http://maps.google.com/maps/ms?ie=UTF8&#038;msa=0&#038;msid=214778165466350903712.000498d59a81898067f48&#038;t=f&#038;ecpose=17.42651368,78.377261,944.13,0,44.996,0&#038;ll=17.429836,78.377261&#038;spn=0.001459,0.003214&#038;output=embed</a>  <br />View <a style="text-align:left;color:#0000ff;" href="http://maps.google.com/maps/ms?ie=UTF8&amp;msa=0&amp;msid=214778165466350903712.000498d59a81898067f48&amp;t=f&amp;ecpose=17.42651368,78.377261,944.13,0,44.996,0&amp;ll=17.429836,78.377261&amp;spn=0.001459,0.003214&amp;source=embed">Hiking Near Hi-Tech</a> in a larger map   <br />View <a style="text-align:left;color:#0000ff;" href="http://maps.google.com/maps/ms?ie=UTF8&amp;msa=0&amp;msid=214778165466350903712.000498d59a81898067f48&amp;t=f&amp;ll=17.429836,78.377261&amp;spn=0.001459,0.003214&amp;source=embed">Hiking Near Hi-Tech</a> in a larger map   <p>I won’t write much about the hiking as it has been wonderfully jotted down in <a href="http://kunal.wordpress.com" target="_blank">Kunal’s Blog</a></p>  <p><a title="http://kunal.wordpress.com/2011/01/02/a-sunday-well-spent/" href="http://kunal.wordpress.com/2011/01/02/a-sunday-well-spent/">http://kunal.wordpress.com/2011/01/02/a-sunday-well-spent/</a></p>  <p>I </p>  <p><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/s/c/bin/slideshow.swf">http://picasaweb.google.com/s/c/bin/slideshow.swf</a></p>  <p>Following are the plus I experienced</p>  <p>1.Fresh air (Needed after my sinus surgery :))    <br />2.Get a lot of extra time early morning , don’t have to rush to office     <br />3.will feel sleepy early at night ;) [Yet to realize today ]</p> <a href="http://s3.clevr.com/CleVR?xmldomain=http://www.clevr.com/&#038;mov=25337">http://s3.clevr.com/CleVR?xmldomain=http://www.clevr.com/&#038;mov=25337</a>  <p style="text-align:center;width:450px;"><a title="Panoramic view of Hiking HiTech" href="http://www.clevr.com/pano/25337?utm_source=embed&amp;utm_content=25337&amp;utm_medium=embed">Panorama of Hiking HiTech </a></p>
