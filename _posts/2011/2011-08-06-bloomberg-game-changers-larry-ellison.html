Few years back I watched him in <a href="http://neilghosh.com/2009/10/17/triumph-of-the-nerds/" target="_blank">The Triumph of Nerds</a> and Larry's interview seemed to be very futuristic as it was shot on 1995 , soon after windows 95 was launched. This one of the amazing story and covers major facts will date. It all started with the relational database's research paper and took off like a flight. There were some bad moments in early 1990s. It was incredible to know that government sued the company but the private company ended up wining it. Oracle's product might not be known to common people like Google's but definitely most of our day to day life relies on Oracle productsÂ  at some point , be it a mobile phone company's business or Pharmacy's consignments.<br/><br/><object width="640" height="360" classid="clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0"><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" /><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always" /><param name="flashvars" value="file_url=http%3A//videos.bloomberg.com/65006906.flv&amp;autoplay=false&amp;site=blp.embed&amp;zone=vod/gamechangers&amp;EnableLogging=true&amp;LoggingDomain=www.bloomberg.com&amp;sz=1x1&amp;tile=1&amp;poster_url=http%3A//www.bloomberg.com/apps/data%3Fpid%3Davimage%26iid%3Diz3JG18fxh0Y" /><param name="src" value="http://cdn.gotraffic.net/flash/BloombergMediaPlayer.swf" /><param name="allowfullscreen" value="true" /><param name="wmode" value="opaque" /><embed width="640" height="360" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" src="http://cdn.gotraffic.net/flash/BloombergMediaPlayer.swf" allowFullScreen="true" allowscriptaccess="always" flashvars="file_url=http%3A//videos.bloomberg.com/65006906.flv&amp;autoplay=false&amp;site=blp.embed&amp;zone=vod/gamechangers&amp;EnableLogging=true&amp;LoggingDomain=www.bloomberg.com&amp;sz=1x1&amp;tile=1&amp;poster_url=http%3A//www.bloomberg.com/apps/data%3Fpid%3Davimage%26iid%3Diz3JG18fxh0Y" allowfullscreen="true" wmode="opaque" /></object><br/><br/>Courtesy http://www.bloomberg.com/video/65006540/<br/><br/>Note The views expressed on this blog are those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Oracle
