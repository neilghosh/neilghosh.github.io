<p>I have been a big fan of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemanta_Kumar_Mukhopadhyay" target="_blank">Hemanta Kumar</a> (The great Hindi/Marathi and Bengali Playback singer ) since the days I 1st came to know songs in the films in TV are not sang by the actor himself during acting :) . I have compiled the following <object width="640" height="390"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/3K8TH8LBs-w&hl=en_US&feature=player_embedded&version=3"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowScriptAccess" value="always"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/3K8TH8LBs-w&hl=en_US&feature=player_embedded&version=3" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowfullscreen="true" allowScriptAccess="always" width="640" height="390"></embed></object>
