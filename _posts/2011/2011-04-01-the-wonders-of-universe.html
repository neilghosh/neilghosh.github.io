After wonderful episodes of <a href="http://neilghosh.com/2010/04/25/bbc-wonders-of-the-solar-system/" target="_blank">The wonders of the Solar System</a> <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/profbriancox" target="_blank">Prof. Brian Cox</a> is back in BBC with his brand new episodes of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wonders_of_the_Universe" target="_blank">The Wonders of the Universe.</a><br/><br/>I am very much excited to watch all the episode which not only does a great awareness of basic science among people but also tries describe complicated astronomical theories in plain English. UK residents can watch it <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00zdhtg" target="_blank">here</a><br/><br/><a href="http://www.youtube.com/p/ED63D891C6ECC17F?hl=en_US&#038;fs=1">http://www.youtube.com/p/ED63D891C6ECC17F?hl=en_US&#038;fs=1</a><br/><br/>The above 3 out of 4 episodes in this season has been already aired.
