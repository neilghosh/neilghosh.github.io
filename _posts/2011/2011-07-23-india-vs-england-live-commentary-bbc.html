It was 1996 and I was quite addicted to cricket and BBC. Everyday I had a habit of tuning my radio to the medium wave frequency of BBC World Service and Voice of America. I still remember listening to live commentary of the<a href="http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/match/63714.html"> lords test</a> when India toured England 15 years  ago. Somehow missed the 1st test, may be because it was the same old typical 90's Indian team. 2nd test was special because two young Indian cricketer made their debut at the mecca of cricket , the same guys would change the face of Indian cricket and become legends in next decade. Also it was the last test of <a href="http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/content/player/9098.html" target="_blank">Dickie Bird</a> as an umpire , whom I admired the most. Today it is the 2000th official test match  in cricket history and here is the live commentary broadcasted by BBC online.<br/><br/><iframe src="http://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/console/bbc_radio_five_live_sports_extra" width="400" height="690"></iframe><br/><br/>Your browser does not support iframes. <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/console/bbc_radio_five_live_sports_extra">click here</a> to listen from BBC site<br/><br/>&nbsp;
