Lately I was busy explaining people that<br/><ol><br/>	<li>Earthquake in Japan has nothing to do with the supermoon. <a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2011/03/11/no-the-supermoon-didnt-cause-the-japanese-earthquake/" target="_blank">Here is Phil Plait's blog</a> explaining everything.</li><br/>	<li>The size of the moon won't be so so big on that day that naked human eye can distinguish. The size of the moon varies like this every month but this time it happened to be a full moon when moon was closest to the earth. Here is an article covering <a href="http://www.perseus.gr/Astro-Lunar-Scenes-Apo-Perigee-2010.htm">all details</a>.</li><br/></ol><br/>Here is the video I shot from my tarrace with my handy with 50x optical zoom at 8.30 PM Indian time on 19th march 2011<br/><br/>[youtube http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uj1i7Co4RM?rel=0&amp;w=640&amp;h=390]
