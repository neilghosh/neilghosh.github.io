<a title="Yahoo Pipes" href="http://pipes.yahoo.com" target="_blank">http://pipes.yahoo.com</a><br/><br/>A powerful composition tool to aggregate, manipulate, and mashup content from around the web.<br/><br/>One of theÂ  most usefulness of this tool was realized when I could aggregate all the photo together taken by different friends in different cameras and uploaded separately in their Picasa or flicker web albums<br/><br/>I just took the RSS feed of different sources and used a simple UNION operator using yahoo pipes and Bingo ! All the pictures of the event are now together and can be distributed as a single stream.<br/><a href="http://www.jumpcut.com/media/flash/jump.swf?id=F4396574585311DC87A2000423CF0184&#038;asset_type=clip&#038;asset_id=F4396574585311DC87A2000423CF0184&#038;asset_url=/media/dyn/84/2fc0/7aaa8b5c719b614fb3f846fd17/lq.flv&#038;eb=1">http://www.jumpcut.com/media/flash/jump.swf?id=F4396574585311DC87A2000423CF0184&#038;asset_type=clip&#038;asset_id=F4396574585311DC87A2000423CF0184&#038;asset_url=/media/dyn/84/2fc0/7aaa8b5c719b614fb3f846fd17/lq.flv&#038;eb=1</a>
