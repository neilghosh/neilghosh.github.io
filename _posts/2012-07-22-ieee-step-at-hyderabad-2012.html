In April this year we <a title="IEEE GOLD STEP Event at Warangal on 7th April 2012" href="http://neilghosh.com/2012/04/08/ieee-gold-step-event-at-warangal-on-7th-april-2012/">organized the IEEE STEP program</a> at Warangal.on behalf of <a href="http://ieeehyd.org/main/Gold-about.php" target="_blank">GOLD (Graduates Of Last Decade ) Affinity group</a> of <a href="http://ieeehyd.org/main/index.php" target="_blank">IEEE Hyderebad section</a>.<br/><br/>Since this program is for the graduating students and most of the engineering  colleges in the state of Andhra Pradesh is in the capital city Hyderabad, we wanted to organize the season 2 of the<a href="http://www.ieee.org/membership_services/membership/gold/step.html" target="_blank"> STEP (Students Transition and Elevation Program )</a> in Hyderabad and make it big. IEEE HQ and the local section has been supporting us enough financially to organize both of them.<br/><br/><a href="http://s1116.photobucket.com/albums/k579/neilghosh/blog%20images/?action=view&amp;current=STEP_JULY_2012.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i1116.photobucket.com/albums/k579/neilghosh/blog%20images/STEP_JULY_2012.jpg" alt="Photobucket" width="609" height="776" border="0" /></a><br/><br/>The planning started couple of months back with long trailing email chains among the GOLD volunteers and students volunteers. Volunteers like Arif and Raheem came forward to offer their university seminar hall and other facilities in the campus. <a href="http://www.mjcollege.ac.in/" target="_blank">MJCET (Muffakham Jah College of Engineering and Technology)</a> is situated in the heart of the city and turned out to be the most convenient location for students around the city. Also the seminar hall was very well equipped with audio/video facility.<br/><br/>From the inception, GOLD vice chair Preeti took the lead and co-ordinated with other volunteers to get all the arrangements done.  We approached speakers who were from the top companies and they agreed to spend their Saturday among graduating students motivating them and showing the way how to make a transition to professional life.<br/><br/>Weeks before the event we created the following flyer and also spread the word using our <a href="https://www.facebook.com/goldhyd" target="_blank">Facebook Page </a><br/><br/>On the day of event , the number of audience was very encouraging. Section chair <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/atulnegi" target="_blank">Dr.Atul Negi</a> addressed the audience and speakers started giving their talks. <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/profile/view?id=18470440&amp;authType=NAME_SEARCH&amp;authToken=yNYh&amp;locale=en_US&amp;srchid=b7c0176c-e01f-4453-970f-61c06476effc-0&amp;srchindex=1&amp;srchtotal=6&amp;goback=.fps_PBCK_*1_Ashish_Daniel_*1_*1_*1_*1_*2_*1_Y_*1_*1_*1_false_1_R_*1_*51_*1_*51_true_*1_in%3A0_*2_*2_*2_*2_*2_*2_*2_*2_*2_*2_*2_*2_*2_*2_*2_*2_*2_*2_*2&amp;pvs=ps&amp;trk=pp_profile_name_link" target="_blank">Ashish Daniel</a> talked about how to do the home work before appearing in the interview and how important goal setting is success. <a href="http://in.linkedin.com/pub/kavita-lal/13/b0a/837" target="_blank">Kavita Lal</a> shared her experience how professional and college life style is different and what is expected from an employee by an organization. <a href="http://in.linkedin.com/in/lavanyamenon28" target="_blank">Lavanya Menon</a> shared a very inspiring presentation with so many practical points which were essential to balance work and life. I would try to share last 4 slides of her and play over and over to inspire and get inspired. All her slides has some interesting note with examples.  Finally <a href="http://about.me/harish.krishnan" target="_blank">Harish Krishan</a> talked about what it takes to do what someone really like doing and eventually to be an entrepreneur . All the talks were super quality and every one had something unique to offer. It may be mere luck that we got all the such fine speakers together in an event. Section chair presented mementos to the speakers and wrapped up the session with final remark.<br/><br/>I really want to thank all the speakers, volunteers and audience for executing the event successfully inspite of rain and  traffic.<br/><object width="600" height="400" classid="clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0"><param name="src" value="https://picasaweb.google.com/s/c/bin/slideshow.swf" /><param name="flashvars" value="host=picasaweb.google.com&amp;captions=1&amp;hl=en_US&amp;feat=flashalbum&amp;RGB=0x000000&amp;feed=https%3A%2F%2Fpicasaweb.google.com%2Fdata%2Ffeed%2Fapi%2Fuser%2F115190779287944617426%2Falbumid%2F5767841508785820897%3Falt%3Drss%26kind%3Dphoto%26hl%3Den_US" /><param name="pluginspage" value="http://www.macromedia.com/go/getflashplayer" /><embed width="600" height="400" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" src="https://picasaweb.google.com/s/c/bin/slideshow.swf" flashvars="host=picasaweb.google.com&amp;captions=1&amp;hl=en_US&amp;feat=flashalbum&amp;RGB=0x000000&amp;feed=https%3A%2F%2Fpicasaweb.google.com%2Fdata%2Ffeed%2Fapi%2Fuser%2F115190779287944617426%2Falbumid%2F5767841508785820897%3Falt%3Drss%26kind%3Dphoto%26hl%3Den_US" pluginspage="http://www.macromedia.com/go/getflashplayer" /></object><br/><br/><a href="http://fb.me/goldhyd" target="_blank"><strong>http://fb.me/goldhyd</strong></a><br/><br/>More on this event details can be found in IEEE Hyderabad Section's <a href="http://ieeehyd.org/main/Event-Detailes.php?id=14" target="_blank">website</a>.
