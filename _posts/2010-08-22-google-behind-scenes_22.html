<a href="http://video.google.com/googleplayer.swf?docid=-1508211417393454786&#038;hl=en&#038;fs=true">http://video.google.com/googleplayer.swf?docid=-1508211417393454786&#038;hl=en&#038;fs=true</a>  <p>This documentary shows how Google works behind the scenes and describes the ultimate goals of Google. Primarily it is to collect ALL information available worldwide. At the moment this is mostly about websites, but e.g. with Google Books they are allready expanding to printed media - and with Google Video (and Youtube) they are also expanding to movies. More information sources are going to be included in Googles data-collection. Of course their slogan is “Don’t be evil“, but the question is what power does a company has, that knows about the “entire” information available worldwide?</p>
