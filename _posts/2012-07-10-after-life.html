I don't believe in after life, I think human body is a biological machine which stops functioning after death , that's it.<br/><br/>But there are lives around us who continue.  One of my colleague <a href="http://thingslearntaftermithun.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">shared a blog</a> on a real experience how disastrous can life be after an unexpected death of a family member. The author mentions few lessons she learned after loosing her husband and all information with him.<br/><br/>My friend  shared the following an article about <a href="http://www.investmentkit.com/articles/2012/05/how-to-reclaim-your-money-in-unclaimed-investments-in-insurance-post-office-ppf-etc/" target="_blank">claiming money</a> stuck at various investments.<br/><br/>On a lighter note of you are worried about your Facebook status after death, there is <a href="http://www.time.com/time/business/article/0,8599,1932803,00.html" target="_blank">an article</a> for you :)
