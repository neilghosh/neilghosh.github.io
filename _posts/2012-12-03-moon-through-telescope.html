Last time I <a title="Jupiter Video" href="http://neilghosh.com/2012/11/19/jupiter-video/">posted </a>about the video of Jupiter I took using my telescope and a webcam. On 28th November there was a partial eclipse of the Moon but I was lucky enough to get a glimpse of it because of my geographic location. However because it was a full moon , it was very bright and I manage to capture some videos and tried to chop and stack the frames using registax.<br/><br/><iframe src="http://player.vimeo.com/video/54507857?badge=0" frameborder="0" width="613" height="490"></iframe><br/><br/>I did some quick and dirty processing to get this image out of the video but I promise, it will get better when I learn more about registax<br/><br/><a href="http://neilghosh.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/Moon.bmp"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-1346" title="Moon" src="http://neilghosh.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/Moon.bmp" alt="" width="616" height="499" /></a>
