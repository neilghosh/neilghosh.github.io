I have been struggling with the proportion since along time and time again I end up asking my friends for help as I have a habit of depending on my memory instead of making notes.Finally I though of noting it down permanently in my blog as this is the most visited site by me ;) , also I can invite my expert friends to fine tune the proportion and make it close to perfection.<br/><br/>Here are the steps I followed today<br/><br/>1.Take water (in a pot) , half of the total volume of tea we are trying to make. Eg. for 2 cups of tea, take one cup of water.I don't recommend mineral water or filter water which we take for drinking because even if we take ordinary water , it  is going to be boiled in the process of making the tea.<br/><br/>2.Keep the pot with water on the burner and start warming it up.<br/><br/>3.Take  0.75 fraction of tea spoon of tea per cup into the water. Eg. 1.5 tea spoon of tea powder if we are trying to make  2 cups of tea.<br/><br/>4.Keep the water with tea boiling till the color changes and it starts to come out of the pot.<br/><br/>5.Now minimize the flame (usually called as "sim") to avoid over boiling and spilling over the pot.<br/><br/>6.Add <a href="http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=milk" target="_blank">milk</a>, (other) half of the total volume of tea we are trying to make. Eg. for 2 cups of tea, take one cup of milk.<br/><br/>7.After few minutes add <a href="http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=sugar" target="_blank">sugar </a>2 tea spoon  per cup into the water. Eg. 4 tea spoon of sugar if we are trying to make  2 cups of tea.<br/><br/>8.Now switch off the burner, mix the sugar with a spoon.<br/><br/>9.Now directly Strain the liquid (hopefully well made tea :D  ) in the pot into tea cups.<br/><br/>[caption id="attachment_344" align="alignnone" width="384" caption="Straining the tea"]<a href="http://neilghosh.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/tea.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-344" title="tea" src="http://neilghosh.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/tea.jpg?w=296" alt="Strain Tea" width="384" height="389" /></a>[/caption]<br/><br/>That's all.Now drink the <a href="http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=tea" target="_blank">tea </a>when it is moderately warm as I have some bad experience with burnt tongue.<br/><br/>I know its not the perfect recipe, so PLEASE give your valuable comments below this post.<br/><br/>Courtesy - <a href="http://agrawaldeepak.com/" target="_blank">Deepak </a>, Pinky
