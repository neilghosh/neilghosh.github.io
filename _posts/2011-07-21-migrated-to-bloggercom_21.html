<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"><br/><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br/><a href="http://wordpress2blogger.appspot.com/wp2b.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://wordpress2blogger.appspot.com/wp2b.png" /></a></div><br/>This blog was earlier hosted in <a href="http://www.xtreemhost.com/">xtreemhost</a> which gave me decent uptime and features till now. This includes 5GB of space , PHP, MySQL and FTP log in with no ads. However sometimes the webhost got blacklisted by some search engines and protection agents like McAfee and my website became inaccessible.Since I hosted this as wordpress the ftp file size limit of 3 Mb did not allow me to upload the zipped latest WordPress file to the server. which was about 3.6 Mb. wordpress.com is a very good option of hosting wordpress cms but it did not allow me to map my domain name (www.neilghosh.com) for free. Hence I headed towards google and decided to migrate this blog to Bloggers.com . The wordpress export file I generated from the Dashboard was used to generate the equivalent bloggers xml file using the service <a href="http://wordpress2blogger.appspot.com/">wordpress2blogger</a> and imported the same to blogger. Some of the earlier embedded stuff and php services could not be migrated properly&nbsp; but I am trying to fix them up as time goes. Blogger.com also allowed me to associate my domain name with a specific blog. I will definitely miss the wordpress plugins but bloggers seems to me simple and seamless and I can focus on my content as I do not have to administer the hosting any more. I will still use the free php , mySQL host for hosting the PHP bases services I make. My old blog is still available at <a href="http://wp.neilghosh.com/">wp.neilghosh.com</a> .<br/><br/>In this process I lost all my WordPress pages and widgets which could not be imported but I am trying to make a clean start so that it does not degrade the integrity over the time. <br/><br/>Thanks to <a href="http://godaddy.com/">GoDaddy.com </a>for easy configuration of domain settings , However their free basic PHP and MySQL hosting was not much of my use as they included ads in it. I think I can use it for hosting my php programs.<br/><br/>I will probably use picasa for image hosting and dropbox for file hosting.</div>
