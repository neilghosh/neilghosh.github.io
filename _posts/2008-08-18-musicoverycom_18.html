<a href="http://Musicovery.com" target="_self"><strong>Musicovery</strong> </a>is an interactive and customised <span class="mw-redirect">webradio</span>. Listeners can intuitively find music matching their mood. The more they listen and rate songs, the more radio programmes get personalized. Reviewers have commented that unlike services that are governed by the user's choice of artist or genre, this method results in more discovery of artists to which the user might not otherwise have been exposed;Musicovery provides dance mix â€” with the ability to specify the desired dance tempo and similar artist features, as well as the option of a low fidelity free service or a premium service with better sound. Users have the option to limit the selection to a specific year or range of years, as well as to deselect any genre, and genres are color-keyed to the graphic interface.<br/><br/>The webradio service is accessible on mobile phone (on 3G/Symbian Nokia Devices).<br/><br/>Music files provided by the service are streamed, not downloaded, and the listener can buy all the songs played or tagged as favorite from major online music retailers iTunes, Amazon, and eBay.<br/><br/>[caption id="" align="alignleft" width="366" caption="musicovery.com"]<a href="http://musicovery.com"><img title="musicovery.com" src="http://bp3.blogger.com/_vcb-PJ7K4v8/R5meeOPslkI/AAAAAAAABEw/pcaWT1qLthc/s400/musicovery1.JPG" alt="musicovery.com" width="366" height="368" /></a>[/caption]
