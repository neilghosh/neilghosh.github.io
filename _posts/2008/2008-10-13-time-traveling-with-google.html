<a href="http://www.google.com/search2001.html" target="_blank">http://www.google.com/search2001.html</a><br/><br/>In honor of it's 10th-year anniversary, Google has made available their search index from January 2001. In some cases, the results can be pulled from an Internet Archive. Here a some interesting findings while "Googling" back in time<img class="alignleft" src="http://www.google.com/google.jpg" alt="" width="354" height="116" /><br/><br/>This is the world of Google circa 2001, a time capsule adventure available until the end of the month at Google.com/search2001.html in celebration of the search engine's 10th birthday. (Google has released the earliest good version of its index available, which, for technical reasons, is from 2001 rather than 1998.)<br/><br/>Being an employee , the 1st thing I searched was "oracle" and got this link<br/><br/>http://web.archive.org/web/20011217200518/www.oracle.com/<br/><br/>this took me to oracle home page when I was in 11th standard. when i searched <a href="http://www.google.com/search2001/search?q=gmail&amp;hl=en&amp;btnG=Search" target="_blank">"gmail" </a>, it didnt exist.<br/><br/>Note : you can always try http://www.archive.org/index.php for older version of any web page
