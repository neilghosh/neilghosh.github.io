Remember when you were sure your computer had all the hard drive space you'd ever need? Gigabytes sell for less than a buck a pop nowadays, but with video, music, photos and web clippings hogging up hard drives more and more each day, that "Low Disk Space" message may come a lot sooner than you ever expected. Where did all those gigabytes go? <img class="alignnone" title="JDiskReport" src="http://www.lifehacker.com/assets/resources/2006/12/jdiskreport-thumb.gif" alt="" width="475" height="363" /><br/><br/>If you need to free up space on your hard drive fast, your best bet is to start wiping out the big space-eaters right away. But don't waste time guessing who they are; there are easy ways to inventory what's clogging your hard drive. Free tools for Windows, Mac and Linux map your hard drive usage so you can get a birds-eye view of what's taking up most of your coveted hard drive space.<br/><br/>Here are some of the tools I have used.<br/><br/><strong><a href="http://www.hushpage.com/FoSi/fosi.html" target="_blank">FosiX</a> </strong>A lot of features and appealing visuals but 30 days trials(<a href="http://www.hushpage.com/FoSi/Fosi_setup.zip">Download</a>)<br/><br/><strong><a href="http://jgoodies.com/freeware/jdiskreport" target="_blank">JDiskReport </a></strong><a href="http://jgoodies.com/freeware/jdiskreport" target="_blank">(</a><a href="http://jgoodies.com/downloads/index.html">Download</a>)<br/><br/>multi-platform freeware <a href="http://jgoodies.com/freeware/jdiskreport">JDiskReport</a> also provides graphical disk usage statistics using more common pie/line/bar charts.Since JDiskReport is Java-based (hence the J), you'll have to <a href="http://www.java.com/en/">download and install Java</a> in order to run it.<br/><br/><a href="http://windirstat.sourceforge.net/"><strong>WinDirStat</strong></a> (<a href="http://windirstat.info/wds_current_setup.exe">Download</a>)<br/><br/>The free, open-source utility <a href="http://windirstat.sourceforge.net/">WinDirStat</a> displays your disk usage in a color-coded map that shows what file types and folders take up the most space on your hard drive.
