<strong><a href="http://indiarailinfo.com" target="_blank">Indian Rail Info</a> is a free Google Maps mashup which allows you to visualize the current geographical position of any Indian train.</strong><br/><br/><a href="http://indiarailinfo.com/train/map/348/1/35"><img class="alignleft" title="Rail Map" src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_vcb-PJ7K4v8/SRXUuRWuEII/AAAAAAAAEjU/8Lol2qW76rc/s400/train_map.JPG" alt="" width="372" height="354" /></a><br/><br/>Here some great news for the Indian Railway geeks.After <a href="http://erail.in" target="_blank">erail.in</a>, here is an interesting site to know the current running status.So that one does not have to call the Railway inquiry everytime.<br/><br/>For example, theÂ <a class="detailsprominent" href="http://indiarailinfo.com/train/348/1/35">Coromandel Express/2841</a> has crossed Bhubaneswar at 9:20pm IST.<br/><br/>Unfortunately this site does not extrapolate this data to guess the location between two junctions, so the train is still shown at Bhubaneswar.
