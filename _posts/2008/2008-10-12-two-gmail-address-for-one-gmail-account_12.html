When we create a gmail account we actually get two email address like this<br/><ul><br/>	<li> userid@gmail.com</li><br/>	<li> userid@googlemail.com</li><br/></ul><br/>the second one You probably donâ€™t know<br/>now you can save your GMail mailbox from spam with this trick<br/><br/>Give your @googlemail.com address to very important contacts and you can put that in the visiting card while keep the @gmail.com address for public use like u can place it on your blogs, website or in forums . Then set a Gmail filter such that all email messages with @googlemail.com in the header go a special folder so you will never miss important emails
