<p>&#160;</p>  <p>I found the following videos and comments shared by the YouTube an <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/me2prophet" target="_blank">user</a> .Really These videos are made in such an interesting way that a non science/mathematics student can enjoy the video’s humor .Do watch them.</p>  <blockquote>   <p>&#160;</p>    <p>The Zero, decimal system, Indian numerals, astronomy, astrology, trigonometry, ayurveda, chemistry, everything even dream-analysis are some of the numerous contributions of scholars from India.     <br />Unfortunately, the bias has always been against giving no credit whatsoever to the Indian mind. For instance, I was taught in school that the numerals we use are &quot;Arabic Numerals&quot;. Why?      <br />…..</p>    <p>……</p>    <p>The story of numbers is the story of civilization. Terry Jones (&quot;Monty Python's Flying Circus&quot;) goes on a humor-filled journey to recount the amazing tale behind Indian numerals.     <br />Interesting Facts:      <br />* Baudhayana gave the 'Pythagoras theorem' centuries before the Greeks in 800 BC.       <br />* Pingala (400 BC) invented the binary number system which is the basic of computer operations.       <br />* Indian astronomer, Aryabhatta was the first to have propounded the theory that the earth was a sphere in the 5th century.       <br />* Indian astronomer, Brahmagupta, estimated in the 7th century that the circumference of the earth was 5000 yojanas. A yojana is around 7.2 kms. Calculating on this basis we see that the estimate of 36,000 kms as the earth's circumference comes quite close to the actual circumference known today.</p> </blockquote>  <p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/v/gulApUKih2w?version=3">http://www.youtube.com/v/gulApUKih2w?version=3</a></p>  <p>   <br /><a href="http://www.youtube.com/v/FRpG6SKnRYA?version=3">http://www.youtube.com/v/FRpG6SKnRYA?version=3</a></p>
