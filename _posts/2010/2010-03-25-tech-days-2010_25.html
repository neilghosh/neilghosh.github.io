With multiple tracks, 50+ sessions, hands-on labs, in-depth technology coverage, and exciting keepsakes, Tech Days 2010 is not just another conference to attend. It's THE conference to attend.<br/><br/>It was incredible to meet <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Gosling" target="_blank">James Gosling</a> (<a title="http://blogs.sun.com/jag/" href="http://blogs.sun.com/jag/">http://blogs.sun.com/jag/</a>) , He was the keynote speaker on the day 1 (24th march) at <a href="http://www.sercononline.com/suntechdays10/index.htm" target="_blank">Tech days</a> by Oracle.  Major highlight was JavaFx which he not only demonstrated but also his entire slide turned out to be a JavaFx program by him which was only 400 odd lines of code. That was productivity at its best.<br/><br/><img class="alignnone" title="With Chuck-Munn Lee" src="https://fbcdn-sphotos-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-snc6/35770_419750836304_517116304_4569160_7310340_n.jpg" alt="" width="435" height="297" /><br/><br/>The sessions started with a wonderful talk by <a href="http://blogs.sun.com/arungupta/entry/day_1_tech_days_20101" target="_blank">Arun Gupta</a> and followed by various other speakers like <a href="http://amahanty.wordpress.com/2010/04/02/tech-days-2010-hyderabad-and-chennai/">Abhishek Mahanty</a> and <a href="http://java.sun.com/developer/technicalArticles/Interviews/cmlee_qa.html" target="_blank">chuck Mun Lee</a>.Reports of both <a href="http://blogs.oracle.com/arungupta/entry/day_1_tech_days_20101http://" target="_blank">Day 1</a> and <a href="http://blogs.oracle.com/arungupta/entry/day_2_tech_days_2010" target="_blank">Day 2</a> can be found in <a href="https://twitter.com/arungupta" target="_blank">Arun's</a> blog.
