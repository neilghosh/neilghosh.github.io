<p>I was taught in school books and many of my friends still feel “Good” to because of the theory called “Aryan invasion theory” which suggests that India was invaded and conquered by nomadic light-skinned Indo-European tribes from Central Asia around 1500-100 BC, who overthrew an earlier and more advanced dark-skinned Dravidian civilization from which they took most of what later became Hindu culture.I was always skeptical about it but had no evidence to argue about&#160; it with my friends.</p>  <p>Recently I was told by my uncle <a href="http://ch.linkedin.com/pub/ranbir-sinha/1/112/405" target="_blank">Dr. Ranbir Sinha</a>&#160; that many of the modern researchers think this theory is not correct and I continued to search in internet for proof. I came across the following documentary video which gives enough proof that “Aryan invasion theory” was just trick by western world to take credits away from ancient Indian science and civilization , similar to what they did by calling Indian numbers as “Arabic” (<a href="http://neilghosh.com/2010/11/02/the-story-of-numbers-0-and-1-indian-numerals-or-arabic/" target="_blank">see my previous post</a> )</p>  <p>This also slams those Indians who show off superior being “Aryans” , not sure about the reason.</p>  <p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/v/MO8-JCK45tc?version=3">http://www.youtube.com/v/MO8-JCK45tc?version=3</a></p>  <p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_K0aTOTW8hU&amp;feature=related" target="_blank">Part 2</a></p>  <p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsLbejnRjV8" target="_blank">Part 3</a></p>  <p><a href="http://www.hindunet.org/hindu_history/ancient/aryan/aryan_frawley.html" target="_blank">The Myth of the Aryan Invasion of India By David Frawley</a></p>
