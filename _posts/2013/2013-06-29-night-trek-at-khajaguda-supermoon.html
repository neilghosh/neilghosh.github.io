Yes it was supermoon night but cloud cover ruined it it. While it is proved that supermoon is one of the most over credited astronomical event , still its one of the reason to go out and enjoy the nature at night. Thanks to city light, tough there was no moonlight , we could see the path and do the trek without a torch. We climbed some rocks as well (scrambling). It was monsoon and great time to trek.Thanks to organizers of hats club for holding this <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Hatsclub/events/125457582/?a=ea1_grp&amp;rv=ea1&amp;_af_eid=125457582&amp;_af=event" target="_blank">meetup</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/narnirajesh" target="_blank">Rajesh</a> for the photos from his new Sony DSLR.<br/><br/><a href="http://neilghosh.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC07083.jpg"><img class="alignright size-large wp-image-1535" alt="DSC07083" src="http://neilghosh.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC07083-1024x681.jpg" width="620" height="412" /></a>
