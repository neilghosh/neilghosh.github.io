I have been always a fan of panorama images. There are a lot of photo stitching software which can join many overlapping images to create a single one. I have used <a href="http://photosynth.net/" target="_blank">Photosynth</a> earlier with a lot of satisfaction. There a lot of phones and digital cameras which can do it right out of the camera in panoramic mode, in which you have to slowly move the capturing device and it will continuously take and stitch photos to create larger panorama.Â  While there ares some websites like <a href="http://www.clevr.com/" target="_blank">CleVR</a> and <a href="http://gigapan.org/" target="_blank">GigaPan </a> can help sharing the horizontal panoramas and let embed in various sites, spherical panoramas like the ones taken from photosphere app in Android 4.2 cameras could not be embedded in a straight forward way without doing <a href="https://developers.google.com/photo-sphere/web/" target="_blank">some HTML coding</a>. Finally I found a site called <a href="http://sphereshare.net" target="_blank">SphereShare.net</a> for this purpose. Following is the embedded photo I took <a href="http://sphereshare.net/#!/s/31e28684f440a14aea24f404de0b7da8" target="_blank">uploaded in this site.<br/></a><br/>(Click this link for a wider view.
