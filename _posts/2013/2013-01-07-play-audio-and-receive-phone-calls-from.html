I have been lately trying to operate my phone remotely from my PC when I am at home or work because I don't feel I really need to use my mobile phone when I am already in front of a full fledged computer. Also sometime I keep my phone somewhere in house and miss many calls because of not hearing the ring or not able to reach in time before the ringing stops.<br/><br/>I found a way in Windows 7 to play audio and receive phone calls from Windows 7 using Bluetooth. I use rooted Samsung Galaxy ACE running on Android 2.3.<br/><ol><br/>	<li>Pair your phone with PC</li><br/>	<li>Go to Control PanelAll Control Panel ItemsDevices and Printers in the PC<br/><a href="http://neilghosh.com/2013/01/06/play-audio-and-receive-phone-calls-from-windows-7-using-bluetooth/attachment/1/" rel="attachment wp-att-1371"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1371" alt="Control Panel" src="http://neilghosh.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/1.png" width="579" height="332" /></a></li><br/>	<li>Double click and open the Bluetooth Control<br/><br/><a href="http://neilghosh.com/2013/01/06/play-audio-and-receive-phone-calls-from-windows-7-using-bluetooth/attachment/2/" rel="attachment wp-att-1372"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1372" alt="Bluetooth Control " src="http://neilghosh.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/2.png" width="583" height="353" /></a></li><br/>	<li>Click connect button for using the computer speaker to during phone calls and play music from PC using mobile phone's audio player<br/><br/><a href="http://neilghosh.com/2013/01/06/play-audio-and-receive-phone-calls-from-windows-7-using-bluetooth/attachment/3/" rel="attachment wp-att-1373"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1373" alt="Audio Player" src="http://neilghosh.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/3.png" width="561" height="323" /></a></li><br/>	<li>You will notice a small media player control at the right bottom of the screen where you can play/pause/change songs which is being played in the phone.</li><br/></ol><br/>Note that I have not found a way to choose to pick up calls from PC, it automatically picks up after few rings. May be I have to play around the settings more. Anyway this helps improving the phone signal strength of my phone because we don't have to attach the phone to our ear.
