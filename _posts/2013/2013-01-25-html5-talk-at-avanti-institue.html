Last Saturday I was invited to <a href="http://avanthienggcollege.ac.in/avanthienggcollege-gunthapally/" target="_blank">Avanti Institute Of Technology</a> in Hyderabad for a lecture on HTML5. I presented the <a href="http://neilghosh.com/events/gdg-html5/#/intro" target="_blank">same slides</a> what I presented in <a title="Google Devfest 2012 at Hyderabad" href="http://neilghosh.com/2012/11/06/google-devfest-2012-at-hyderabad/" target="_blank">Google DevFest</a> last year. They have a very active IEEE student branch and volunteers. The audience were from second year to fourth year and relatively more knowledgeable than other colleges. However as usual they were shy enough to ask questions in the class but later I was approached individually regarding some questions.<br/><br/><a href="http://neilghosh.com/2013/01/24/html5-talk-at-avanti-institue/dscn1877/" rel="attachment wp-att-1422"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1422" alt="DSCN1877" src="http://neilghosh.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/DSCN1877-1024x712.jpg" width="620" height="431" /></a>
