On 20th of this month my under grad school <a href="http://vssut.ac.in/">UCE Burla (now VSSUT)</a> <a href="http://vssut.org/">alumni</a> staying in Hyderabad had an get together. Thanks to Sanjay Jena and his friends who let the initiative. It was fun meeting old buddies from college and hostel. Also met a lot of new faces who had joined in later years. Interestingly there were some alumni from the batches of 80s who shared their experience with us what was it like to be in an engineering college in 1980s. These senior people are now in top positions in companies like State Electricity Board and Satyam Computers. No doubt in those era UCE Burla was a top college in India which produced the brightest engineering students.<br/><br/><img class="alignnone" alt="" src="https://fbcdn-sphotos-b-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-snc6/252650_454447817955211_1971689812_n.jpg" width="609" height="240" /><br/><br/><img class="alignnone" alt="" src="https://fbcdn-sphotos-a-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-ash4/406019_454452597954733_1756008911_n.jpg" width="608" height="499" /><br/><br/><img class="alignnone" alt="" src="https://fbcdn-sphotos-c-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-snc6/181137_460527417329681_1798465049_n.jpg" width="611" height="467" />
