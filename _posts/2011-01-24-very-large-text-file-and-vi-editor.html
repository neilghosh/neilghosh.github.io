<p>Once I entered to the world of high scalable computing it became common to handle file larger than 2 Gb. Usually files are more than the amount of ram a computer has. for e.g the English Wikipedia dump is around 9 Gb with 3,500,000 articles. The whole <a href="http://download.wikimedia.org/backup-index.html" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a> seems to be around 29 Gb. The whole file could not be open in common windows editors like notepad or NotePad++.</p>  <p>   <br /><a href="http://www.swiftgear.com/ltfviewer/LTFViewr.zip" target="_blank">LTFViewer</a> is a decent option in windows to open very large files and probably it loads one page at a time into memory.</p>  <p>I went back to VI editor in Linux .Here goes some useful commands.</p>  <p>To switch from Insert Mode to Command Mode, press the Escape (Esc) key. </p>  <p><a title="http://www.sharpened.net/resources/commands/vi" href="http://www.sharpened.net/resources/commands/vi">http://www.sharpened.net/resources/commands/vi</a></p>  <p>Let me know via comment or email if you know any other software in windows which can open very huge text files.</p>
