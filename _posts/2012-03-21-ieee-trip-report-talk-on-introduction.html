On behalf of IEEE CS Chapter of Hyderabad section me and couple of my colleagueÂ  visited <a href="http://www.srecwarangal.ac.in/" target="_blank">SR Engineering college</a> at Warrangal, Hyderabad on 17th March 2012. There were two sessions. 1st session was by me. It was about "Introduction to HTML5". I took a part of the HTML5 <a href="http://slides.html5rocks.com" target="_blank">demo slides</a> from html5rocks.com. Interesting thing about these slides is that they were purely based on HTML/CSS/javaScript and runs on a browser. So there was no traditional power points presentation . This also enabled the inline demos and I did not have to carry extra HTML files for demo. The Demo worked best on the latest version of Google Chrome but most of them was compatible with Mozilla Firefox also. The detailed compatibility chart can found <a href="http://www.findmebyip.com/litmus/" target="_blank">here . </a>In fact you can test your own browser by visiting <a href="http://html5test.com/" target="_blank">this website</a>.<br/><br/><object width="600" height="400" classid="clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0"><param name="src" value="https://picasaweb.google.com/s/c/bin/slideshow.swf" /><param name="flashvars" value="host=picasaweb.google.com&amp;hl=en_US&amp;feat=flashalbum&amp;RGB=0x000000&amp;feed=https%3A%2F%2Fpicasaweb.google.com%2Fdata%2Ffeed%2Fapi%2Fuser%2F115190779287944617426%2Falbumid%2F5721123517032244017%3Falt%3Drss%26kind%3Dphoto%26authkey%3DGv1sRgCMKMlrPQzteuMg%26hl%3Den_US" /><param name="pluginspage" value="http://www.macromedia.com/go/getflashplayer" /><embed width="600" height="400" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" src="https://picasaweb.google.com/s/c/bin/slideshow.swf" flashvars="host=picasaweb.google.com&amp;hl=en_US&amp;feat=flashalbum&amp;RGB=0x000000&amp;feed=https%3A%2F%2Fpicasaweb.google.com%2Fdata%2Ffeed%2Fapi%2Fuser%2F115190779287944617426%2Falbumid%2F5721123517032244017%3Falt%3Drss%26kind%3Dphoto%26authkey%3DGv1sRgCMKMlrPQzteuMg%26hl%3Den_US" pluginspage="http://www.macromedia.com/go/getflashplayer" /></object><br/><br/><br/><br/>The second session was on the lines of core Computer Science. Tiru took a session on "Contributions of Allan Tuning". <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Turing" target="_blank">Allan Tuning</a> is a legendary mathematician who invented Tuning Machine.<br/><br/>Heat at Warrangal was unbearable. However we managed to see couple of places with historical importance. One was <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thousand_Pillar_Temple" target="_blank">Thousand Pillar Temple</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhuvanagiri,_Andhra_Pradesh#Bhongir_Fort" target="_blank">Bhongir Fort </a>.<br/><br/>&nbsp;
