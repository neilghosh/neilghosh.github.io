It has been a while!

I just realised that my last post was in august 2022. Thats nearly 8 months. I doubt if there has been such a long gap in the past between two post. Honestly I don't have anything specific to post today, definately not related to tech. I am just trying to create a habit, of writing, at least of the content that can be posted publicly. Something like snapchat streak, just heard about it from one of my 17 year old cousin though I never used it.  I know, resolutions are taken in the new years usually but after all April is the begining of the financial year in India and in my opinion more things reset in April than January. So its not really a bad time for any
