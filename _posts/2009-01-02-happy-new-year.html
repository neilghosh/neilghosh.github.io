<strong>A</strong>fter a relatively long gap (15th Nov Birthday to 1st Jan New year, I call it rest period though ;-) ) we are back again.OMG ! OMG ! Well I don't have anything special to start with but because it is a good day (I am not superstitious at all and don't believe in "Muhurat" yet) I just though to give some kick-off to the new year with some site statistics.<br/><br/><strong> HAPPY NEW YEAR TO ALL</strong><br/><br/>here are some last years Stats : - [Thanks to <a href="http://www.google.com/analytics/" target="_blank">Google Analytics</a>]<br/><br/>Total Hits in 2008 :- 20797 (Blog started on 1st of August 2008)<br/><br/>45% IE and 37% Firefox (5% of safari Includes my Fav= Google Chrome)<br/><br/><strong>73% XP</strong> and 10% Vista (2% of linux, mostly includes my Ubuntu dev system)<br/><br/>Again Google Search rocks who crawled our page 73% of the time leaving yahoo (14%) behind.Thanks to some amaizing posts like <a href="http://neilghosh.com/blog/solar-eclipse-live-from-china/" target="_blank">View Live solar eclips</a>e , <a href="http://neilghosh.com/blog/trace-india-mobile-number/" target="_blank">Mobile number search in India</a> and<a href="http://neilghosh.com/blog/spot-the-current-geographical-position-of-any-indian-train/"> Live train status and route</a> which brought most of the traffic into this blog.<br/><br/>Meanwhile we have bought the domain neilghosh.com from <a href="http://godaddy.com" target="_blank">GoDaddy.com</a> and  upgraded to wordpress 2.7 (<a href="http://worpress.org" target="_blank">worpress.org</a>) which has got a smooth interface both for audience and webmaster.<br/><br/>We have future plans to put more original contents and use more web 2.0 stuffs like Adobe Flex and dojo components to give the audience a feeling of  cutting edge web technology.<br/><br/>Take care<br/><br/>Neil
