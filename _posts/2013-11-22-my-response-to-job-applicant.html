Lately I have been looking for some mid/senior level Java programmers for my team in <a href="https://careers.ea.com/locations/asia/india/">Hyderabad studio</a>. I got resumes from a lot of sources and decided to respond to some of them with feedback before forwarding them to the talent acquisition department. I took some time two write a lot of details in the feedback because I have been observing a trend in resume writing which do not seem to be correct to me. Here is one of the personal feedback I write to a applicant of my acquaintance  .<br/><blockquote><br/><div>Thanks for sending the resume. Sorry for the delay in reply . I was too busy with office work. At this moment I am not able to forward your resume as it looked to me that the openings I have in my company did not match your profile. However I will keep your resume and  let you know if I find any junior level opening in future. Meanwhile you can consider following points to increase your chances of resume being shortlisted.</div><br/><div>These are my general and personal opinion.</div><br/><div></div><br/><div></div><br/><div><br/><ol><br/>	<li>Communication, when you email someone for career or office work be careful about following general English mistakes.<br/><ol><br/>	<li>Initial/Address should be in Caps e.g. "Hello" or "Hi" (not "hello" or "hi")</li><br/>	<li>Try to address by name e.g. "Hello Neil" . Tech companies do not encourage "Sir", it may sound funny/sarcastic sometimes.</li><br/>	<li>Name should start with upper case. e.g. "Neil" not "neil", "poonam" etc</li><br/>	<li>I would not know what "ASE" is, its your company designation . Either write in full or just write generic titles like "Developer" or "Engineer".</li><br/>	<li>Always check the grammer.</li><br/>	<li>Be careful about the company name you are applying for. I guess you wanted to write "EA" and wrote 'xx' instead. Try to do research about company from internet before you apply.</li><br/>	<li>Avoid short form/SMS language like "pls".</li><br/>	<li>Do not put bullet points when not required like 1, 2... etc in your email. The body started with bullets.</li><br/></ol><br/></li><br/>	<li>Things to avoid in resume<br/><ol><br/>	<li>"potential of implementing java development application software programs" does not mean anything. It could be just "Java programming or development".</li><br/>	<li>What is "oracle coding standards" ? Its not a coding language . It could be PL/SQL. Do not write something which you are not sure of. You will be asked questions and if not answered , it will disappoint the interviewer.</li><br/>	<li>Again, "thorough approach to the work" does not mean anything.</li><br/>	<li>"Currently working" and "till date" in the same sentence does not mean anything.</li><br/>	<li>Nobody works on MS-DOS now and if you put specific ones like Windows8, that may mean you cant work with Windows7 and Linux. OS is not required to be mentioned at all in these kind of jobs.</li><br/>	<li>JavaScript is a single word, if you put space, reviewer will think you are faking it. Same with HTML (all upper case).</li><br/>	<li>In project summery , no one would be interested to know functional details like "MultiVu only officially supports SFU and MDU accounts with PRIN ". Just write technical challenges you solved without going too much company specific. Also remember no one like developers who leak proprietary information.</li><br/>	<li>A resume reviewer will definitely not have any idea about "xxxxx event name at XXXX college". If you want to write about it, you can write specific competitions you won.</li><br/>	<li>"Runners in cricket tournament" means you were just substitute runner for a batsmen. :)</li><br/>	<li>Statements like "Capable of adopting myself to different environment." is too generic. Never write them.</li><br/>	<li>Most important - Read the resume few times if that sounds good.</li><br/></ol><br/></li><br/></ol><br/><div>These are only my observations in the email and resume. There are many more small things to be careful about. However there would be some mistakes without your knowledge, those are fine as long as you know what is correct.</div><br/><div></div><br/><div>Again, these are my personal opinion, I may sound very picky but just wanted to give you heads up before you send the resume somewhere else. Please take these feedback positively and work on it. Employers like people who are ready to change for good.</div><br/><div></div><br/><div>Feel free to email me anytime.</div><br/><div></div><br/><div>All the best</div><br/><div>Neil</div><br/></div></blockquote>
