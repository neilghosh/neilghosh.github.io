<p>Yet another example of “Browser does it all” principle.How many times you have been in a situation when you are not using your own computer or you don’t have the necessary photo editing tool installed. sometime we struggle so much just for cropping and resizing an image quickly.I found few online image editing tool doing as good as&#160; any free photo editing software available for download.    <br />I found <a href="http://aviary.com/tools/phoenix#" target="_blank">Avilary</a> the best among all with so many features and user doesn’t need to go through the account creation process.It also takes direct image URLs without requiring upload from local disk.</p>  <p><a href="http://aviary.com/" target="_blank">http://aviary.com/</a></p> <a href="http://www.viddler.com/player/9f0b00a1/">http://www.viddler.com/player/9f0b00a1/</a>  <p>You can also try other free services like </p>  <h5><a href="http://www.sumopaint.com/web/" target="_blank">Sumo Paint</a></h5>  <h5><a title="https://www.photoshop.com/" href="https://www.photoshop.com/" target="_blank">photoshop.com</a></h5>  <h5><a href="http://www.pixlr.com/" target="_blank">Pixlr</a></h5>  <h5><a href="http://www.picnik.com/" target="_blank">Picnik</a></h5>
