I have decided to make the new posts in [medium](https://medium.com/@neilghosh) which enables me to contribute to collection of community publications like [Google Cloud - Community](https://medium.com/google-cloud).
Here is my first post [Bird Identification With Gemini API](https://medium.com/google-cloud/bird-identification-with-gemini-api-c6af7cfc6532).

I could also put a snippet of post in this blog and redirect the users to the full post in medium but that sounds like a duplicate effort as of now.

Please head over to my latest posts https://medium.com/@neilghosh.

In future I may migrate all the post hosted here (I came here gtom Blogger.com via wordpress :) ) to my medium page but I am skeptical about being locked to a propriatory platform right now.
