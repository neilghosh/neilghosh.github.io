Finally I took out some time to go for a road trip and break my personal record of driving alone.<br/><br/>Following was created using Google Map Engine. However it did not allow me to create more than 3 layers without paying a monthly free.<br/><br/><iframe src="https://mapsengine.google.com/map/embed?mid=zpDaS10JtPcY.kh-juJXQJgXE" height="618" width="618"></iframe><br/><br/>While traveling its useful to note down the coordinates of the place of interest because later it may not be easy to find in the maps for reference. I used an app called GPS essentials which has a "Waypoint" marker that allows the current coordinates to be labeled and saved.  These coordinates were in GPS format i.e. 17° 28.345' instead of 17°28'20'' or 17.493°. The later two format is easily recognized by Google maps. I used an online latitude/longitude converter to find the Google Maps friendly coordinates and marked the spots. For future I have created the below Wolframalpha widget to make this conversion one-click.<br/><br/>&nbsp;<br/><br/><script type="text/javascript" id="WolframAlphaScript3d463f157e344c2abdc1c52ef9a220ca" src="http://www.wolframalpha.com/widget/widget.jsp?id=3d463f157e344c2abdc1c52ef9a220ca"></script><br/><br/>Thanks to <a href="https://twitter.com/aditya_rao">@Aditya_Rao</a> for guiding me in the Mysore city and suggesting the must see spots.<br/><br/>Total distance drove in the trip was 1694 KM.<br/><br/>&nbsp;
