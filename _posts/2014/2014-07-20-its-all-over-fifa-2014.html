<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">The FIFA world cup was pretty much over when German Mario Goetze received the ball on his chest and kicked it inside the Argentine goal post. The world cup season of 1998, 2002 , 2006 and 2010 have been special (be it good or bad) for me , not sure what was special personally this time but I followed almost every match this time.<br /><br />In India Sony SIX broadcasted this event but it started with a very disappointing manner given the fact that John Abraham was in the analyst panel in first few matches. He had done some great movies but no way qualified to be there. Actors should be called to these event only if they paid a lot to do their film promotion :).<br /><br />Apart from cable TV the XBMC plugin <a href="http://www.xbmchub.com/blog/how-to-install-sportsdevil-and-then-update-with-the-new-sportsdevil-fixes-updater-plugin/">Sports Devil</a> played a very important role in live streaming the matches. Both ESPN and BBC 5 Live were airing the audio commentary which was a live saver when were <a href="http://www.neilghosh.com/2014/07/12/tadoba-trip-2014/" title="Tadoba Trip 2014">driving</a> during matches.</div>
