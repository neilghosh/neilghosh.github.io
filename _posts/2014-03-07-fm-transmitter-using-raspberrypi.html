I was looking for a FM radio transmitter and came across <a href="http://www.icrobotics.co.uk/wiki/index.php/Turning_the_Raspberry_Pi_Into_an_FM_Transmitter" target="_blank">this article </a>which explains the use of a raspberryPi to make a quite powerful radio transmitter. There are some commercially available <a href="http://www.amazon.com/FM-Transmitters-MP3-Player-Accessories/b?ie=UTF8&amp;node=13981621" target="_blank">short range FM transmitter</a> for cars which has FM tuner. Also there are few <a href="http://www.amazon.com/0-5-Fail-Safe-Long-Range-Transmitter/dp/B003FO4UHW" target="_blank">long range</a> one available which claims to have almost small city wide range ( of course it is not legally allowed to transmit strong FM signal without a licenseÂ  )<br/><br/><a href="http://www.neilghosh.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Pi.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2223 alignleft" alt="Pi" src="http://www.neilghosh.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Pi-300x274.jpg" width="300" height="274" /></a><br/><br/>Last weekend I tried to follow the above article and succeed ! Also I used a micro USB cable as antenna connected to the 7th pin in the RaspberryPi. The signal was surprisingly strong, I could receive it in my neighbor's house also. I am sure I can make a better antenna.<br/><br/>TODO : I need to find a way to transmit streamed audio next.<br/><br/>&nbsp;
