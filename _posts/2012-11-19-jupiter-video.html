<a title="Stargazing and Leonid meteor Shower 2011" href="http://neilghosh.com/2011/11/28/stargazing-and-leonid-meteor-shower-2011-2/" target="_blank">Last year</a> during Leonid Meteor shower we had gone out to a place bit away from the city lights and spotted some of the objects in the sky. This year I stayed back at my home and waited till the dawn to watch some meteors. The numbers were very disappointing because of the city light's but I managed to capture Jupiter up high near the zenith. It was very bright. Following is the video I shot using my 1.3 mp webcam connected to the 90 mm table top telescope.<br/><iframe src="http://player.vimeo.com/video/53730830?badge=0" frameborder="0" width="610" height="489"></iframe><br/><br/>I could only capture 18 second clip the <a title="Orion StarMax 90mm Table top" href="http://neilghosh.com/2011/11/14/orion-starmax-90mm-table-top/">telescope </a>was alt-Azimuth mounted. Probably next time I would use <a title="Assembling and setting up the telescope" href="http://neilghosh.com/2011/01/22/assembling-and-setting-up-the-telescope/">my 5 inch one</a> with EQ mount using which I can manually track it for longer time tough I don't have motor tracker yet.<br/><br/>I also tried to use <a href="http://www.astronomie.be/registax/" target="_blank">Registax </a>for the first time to chop the frames of the video and stack them. After some wavelet adjustment I managed to get the following sharper image.<br/><br/><a href="http://neilghosh.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Jupiter_FInalw.bmp"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-1332" title="Jupiter" src="http://neilghosh.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Jupiter_FInalw.bmp" alt="" width="603" height="430" /></a><br/><br/>I could see the great red spot just below the equilateral aria. May be better image processing would lead to sharper image.<br/><br/>I probably over did a bit during wavelet processing. This was first time I used this software. Thanks <a href="https://plus.google.com/u/0/113047225282720058964/posts" target="_blank">Mike Rector </a>and the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B10185Hedac" target="_blank">YouTube video</a> for telling me how to use this software. Now I am dying to capture Saturn with this. Unfortunately most of the planets are now almost in a single direction near the sun which makes it very difficult to see and capture. Here is another picture of sky including Orion, Jupiter , Sirius , Aldebran and M45<br/><br/><a href="http://neilghosh.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Orion.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1336" title="Orion" src="http://neilghosh.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Orion-1024x533.jpg" alt="" width="620" height="322" /></a>
