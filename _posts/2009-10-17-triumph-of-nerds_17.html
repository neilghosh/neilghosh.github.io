This film chronicles the rise of the personal computer/home computer beginning in the 1970s with the Altair 8800, Apple II and VisiCalc. It continues through the IBM PC and Apple Macintosh revolution through the 1980s and the mid 1990s at the beginning of the Dot-com boom. It includes interviews with Apple Computer's Steve Jobs and Microsoft's Bill Gates. This three-part film first premiered on PBS in June 1996.  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/p/4D5CD637F73C24C7&#038;hl=en&#038;fs=1">http://www.youtube.com/p/4D5CD637F73C24C7&#038;hl=en&#038;fs=1</a>
