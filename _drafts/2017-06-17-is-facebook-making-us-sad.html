<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">Before I begin any rant, let me clarify - I am a big fan of facebook. Especially beacuse of the way it has connected people is beyond our wildest imagination. It pretty much has everyone I have ever known and knows what is internet and computer. (Some may not even touched a computer, all you need is a smartphone.) Also it is an amaizing piece of technology. Handling flurry of posts, comments and likes in almost real time all over the world. They have also pushed the mobile client technology to the next level at the advent of ReactJS.<br /><br />However I have two problems.<br /><br />Firstly, it is very easy and intutive to use so the reach is unimaginable. As I mentioned you don't need to know the concept of internet or computers to use facebook as oppsed to what we had to know when we started browsing the internet in the late 90s. </div>
