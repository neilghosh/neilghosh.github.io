# Blog Post Rewriting and Improvement Task

## Task Overview
Improve existing blog posts with spell check, grammar correction, and better flow while maintaining the author's personal writing style.

## Instructions
**IMPORTANT**: Follow all guidelines in `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for:
- Jekyll conventions (front matter, categories, layouts)
- Assets and image organization (`assets/{YEAR}/` with descriptive names)
- Writing style preservation (casual, personal, authentic voice)
- Technical formatting and social media embeds

## Specific Improvements to Make
1. **Content Quality**: Fix spelling, grammar, and sentence structure
2. **Organization**: Add section headers and improve flow naturally
3. **Style**: Keep conversational tone - avoid AI-sounding polish
4. **Assets**: Move and rename images to proper directory structure
5. **Technical**: Ensure embeds, links, and code references work properly

## Success Criteria
- ✅ Errors corrected, readability improved
- ✅ Personal voice and authenticity preserved  
- ✅ Images organized per site conventions
- ✅ All technical elements functioning
- ✅ Content flows naturally without over-structuring

## Critical Rule
**Never make the writing sound corporate, academic, or AI-generated.** The goal is a polished version of the author's natural voice, not a professional rewrite.
