[India Community Summit 2019](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OApF3wqgTEI) was a great experience in Bangalore. Tis time it was literally next level. It was held in Ladakh. Not just the sessions and networking during the summit, everyone was super excited to visit Ladakh as its one of the top tourist destination in India.

The agenda of this two and half days of summit was a mix of sessions from special speakers from Google Developer Relations, Comunity Leaders, Cultural Programs and visits to nearby tourist places. However the biggest benefit was probably the oppertunity to connect with people in person which people have been deprived of lately due to pandemic.

The preperation for the jouney involved making sure one is fit for high altitute like Ladakh and packing a bunch of warm cloths including jackets. Weather was actually bright and sunny and not much of use of the jacket untill its late evening when it starts to get a bit cold and breezy.

The beThe stay was one of the best hotels of Ladakh with beautifull view through the window from the room.
